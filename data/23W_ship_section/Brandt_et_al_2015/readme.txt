variables for mean sections:
o2_mean … oxygen [µmol/kg]
s_mean … salinity (Practical Salinity PSS-78)
t_mean … temperature [degC]
u_mean … zonal velocity [cm/s]
v_mean … meridional velocity [cm/s]
sth_mean … mean potential density with reference to surface, i.e. sigma0 [kg/m^3]
gn_mean … mean neutral density with [kg/m^3]

variables for standard deviation of mean sections:
