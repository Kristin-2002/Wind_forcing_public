   abstract = {Sea surface temperature in the eastern equatorial Atlantic Ocean undergoes anomalous warming events of 1-degrees-2-degrees-C every few years. The warm anomalies reach their maximum strength in Northern Hemisphere summer, when equatorial upwelling normally brings cold thermocline water to the surface. By compositing surface observations from a 28-year record, we are able to identify consistent features in anomalies of SST and winds. The composites show that the SST anomalies in northern summer are confined to the eastern equatorial region, with reduced zonal winds to the west and reduced northward trade winds to the east. Accompanying these changes in winds are enhanced convection near the equator caused by a southward shift and intensification of the intertropical convergence zone. Later in the year, SST south of the equator becomes elevated. As a result, by spring of the year following the equatorial anomaly. convection in the western side of the basin is much higher than normal. To understand the ocean dynamics that give rise to these warm anomalies we examine a simulation of the ocean circulation during the 1980s. The authors find that the cause of the warm event in 1984 stretches back to the intense trade winds during the summer and fall of 1983. The unusual winds led to Ekman deepening of the thermocline in the west on both sides of the equator. Late in 1983 the trade winds in the west relaxed, which led to a surge of warm water eastward along the equatorial waveguide. The arrival of anomalous warm water deepened the thermocline throughout the eastern Gulf of Guinea in early 1984 and gradually spread southward and back into the interior basin throughout that year. Secondary factors in elevating equatorial SST were the local advection of warm surface water from the north and a reduction of advection of cool coastal water from the east. In contrast with 1984, the anomalous warming of 1988 seems to have been largely the result of changes in the equatorial winds during spring of the same year. These wind anomalies are likely, themselves, to have resulted from the increase in SST to the east. During both years anomalous deepening of the thermocline in the east (however it was caused) prevented the normal seasonal cooling of the equatorial waters and thus led to elevated SSTs. The eastward shift of heat also had important consequences for the coastal regions of southern Africa.},

   abstract = {Abstract Using a dynamically motivated analysis of observations, and an intermediate-level coupled model, the interannual variability within the equatorial Atlantic is studied. It is found that a significant part of the observed variability can be described by an equatorial coupled mode akin to ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation). The Atlantic mode signature is even more tightly focused on the equator and is situated proportionally farther to the west within the basin than its Pacific counterpart. Model simulations capture the equatorial coupled mode in relatively pure form and, for what are thought to be the most realistic parameter choices, show interannual oscillations favoring a 4-year period, which are not self-sustaining. The simulated spatial patterns agree well with those extracted from observations, including those features that distinguish the Atlantic from the Pacific. Sensitivity experiments show that the Atlantic coupled-mode signal is less robust than the corresponding Pacific ENSO signal bu...},

   abstract = {Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) and composite analyses are used to investigate the development of sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly patterns over the tropical Atlantic. The evolution of large-scale rainfall anomaly patterns over the equatorial Atlantic and South America are also investigated. The EOF analyses revelated that a pattern of anomalous SST and wind stress asy mmetric relative to the equator is the dominant mode of interannual and longer variability over the tropical Atlantic. The most important findings of his study are as follows. Armospheric circulation anomalies precede tehe development of basinwide anomalous SST patterns over the tropical Atlantic. Anomalous SSt originate off the African coast simultaneously with atmospheric circulation anomalies and expand westward afterward. The time lag between wind stress relaxation (strengthening) and maximum SST warning (cooling) is about two months. Anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns over northern tropical Atlantic are phase locked to the seasonal cycle. Composite fields of SLP and wind stress over northern tropical Atlantic can be distinguished from random only within a few months preceding the March-May (MAM) season. Observational evidence is presented to show that the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon in the PAcific influences atmospheric circulation and SST anomalies over northern tropical Atlantic through atmospheric teleconnection patterns into the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The well-know droughts over northeastern Brazil (Nordeste) are a local manifestation of a much larger-scale rainfall anomaly pattern encompassing the whole equatorial Atlantic and Amazon region. Negative rainfall anomalies to the south of the equator during MAM, which is the rainy season for the Nordeste region, are related to an early withdrawal of the intertropical convergence zone toward the warm SST anomalies over the northern tropical Atlantic. Also, it is shown that precipitation anomalies over southern and northern parts of the Nordeste are out of phase: drought years over the northern Nordeste are commonly preceded by wetter years over the southern Nordeste, and vice versa.},

   abstract = {El Niño, the most prominent climate fluctuation at seasonal-to-interannual timescales, has long been known to have a remote impact on climate variability in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, but a robust influence is found only in the northern tropical Atlantic region. Fluctuations in the equatorial Atlantic are dominated by the Atlantic Niño, a phenomenon analogous to El Niño, characterized by irregular episodes of anomalous warming during the boreal summer. The Atlantic Niño strongly affects seasonal climate prediction in African countries bordering the Gulf of Guinea. The relationship between El Niño and the Atlantic Niño is ambiguous and inconsistent. Here we combine observational and modelling analysis to show that the fragile relationship is a result of destructive interference between atmospheric and oceanic processes in response to El Niño. The net effect of El Niño on the Atlantic Niño depends not only on the atmospheric response that propagates the El Niño signal to the tropical Atlantic, but also on a dynamic ocean-atmosphere interaction in the equatorial Atlantic that works against the atmospheric response. These results emphasize the importance of having an improved ocean-observing system in the tropical Atlantic, because our ability to predict the Atlantic Niño will depend not only on our knowledge of conditions in the tropical Pacific, but also on an accurate estimate of the state of the upper ocean in the equatorial Atlantic.},

   abstract = {Most coupled general circulation models (GCMs) perform poorly in the tropical Atlantic in terms of climatological seasonal cycle and interannual variability. The reasons for this poor performance are investigated in a suite of sensitivity experiments with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) coupled GCM. The experiments show that a significant portion of the equatorial SST biases in the model is due to weaker than observed equatorial easterlies during boreal spring. Due to these weak easterlies, the tilt of the equatorial thermocline is reduced, with shoaling in the west and deepening in the east. The erroneously deep thermocline in the east prevents cold tongue formation in the following season despite vigorous upwelling, thus inhibiting the Bjerknes feedback. It is further shown that the surface wind errors are due, in part, to deficient precipitation over equatorial South America and excessive precipitation over equatorial Africa, which already exist in the uncoupled atmospheric GCM. Additional tests indicate that the precipitation biases are highly sensitive to land surface conditions such as albedo and soil moisture. This suggests that improving the representation of land surface processes in GCMs offers a way of improving their performance in the tropical Atlantic. The weaker than observed equatorial easterlies also contribute remotely, via equatorial and coastal Kelvin waves, to the severe warm SST biases along the southwest African coast. However, the strength of the subtropical anticyclone and along-shore winds also play an important role.},

   abstract = {Interannual variability of the upper layers of the Tropical Atlantic is described based on in situ data. An objective analysis used all available temperature observations of the upper Tropical Atlantic between 1979 and 1999 to construct a 4D database. Wind data are used to investigate potential mechanisms which might explain the observed variability. Four remarkable events are described: 1983-1984, 1988-1990, 1994-1995 and 1997-1998. Three of them are characterised as equatorial (1983-1984, 1994-1995, and 1997-1998). The 1988-1990 event is a basin-wide phenomenon which does not involve the same mechanisms as the other three. Results of statistical decomposition in empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) are discussed. There is no evidence of an inter-hemispheric mode on the depth of the 20 degree C-isotherm (D20) and heat content comparable to the observed mode for sea surface temperature (SST) fields. Most energetic patterns for D20 and heat content are dominated by the stronger variability in the northern part of the basin. Influences of other climate signals are investigated. Correlations between the winter NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) index and our standard variables is marginally significant. A positive NAOW (North Atlantic Oscillation of Winter) is associated with SST cooling in a latitude band between 10 degree N and 20 degree N. When applied to the El-Nino index, correlations are much more significant. We found two scales of maximum correlation: at the four month lag after the El-Nino mature phase when the thermocline slope and zonal heat content gradient are maximum along the equator, and at the ten month lag after the mature phase of El-Nino when the thermocline slope weakens and the equatorial gradient of heat content vanished. The correlation with a zonal wind index (average between 30 degree W-35 degree W and 2 degree N-2 degree S) has been computed. Correlation is maximum at the six month lag when the thermocline slope and the zonal heat content gradient are maximum in the equatorial band. This "Atlantic Nino mode is influenced by the Pacific Ocean's variability and reaches a maximum one year after a warm event in the eastern Pacific.},

Regression analysis shows that the three elements of the Bjerknes positive feedback exist in the Atlantic and are spatially similar to those of the Pacific. The cross-correlation functions of the elements of the Bjerknes feedback are also similar and consistent with an ocean–atmosphere coupled mode. However, the growth rate in the Atlantic is up to 50% weaker, and explained variance is significantly lower. The Bjerknes feedback in the Atlantic is strong in boreal spring and summer, and weak in other seasons, which explains why the largest sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) occur in boreal summer. Its seasonality is determined by seasonal variations in both atmospheric sensitivity to SSTA and SSTA sensitivity to subsurface temperature anomalies.},

In this study, observations and a linear equatorial wave model are used to examine the causes of the sharp decrease in SST. It is found that the anomalous cooling along the equator can be traced to an anomalous meridional gradient of SST and associated northwesterly anomalous winds that developed in the equatorial Atlantic the preceding spring.

   abstract = {In the first half of 2009, anomalous cooling of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the equatorial North Atlantic (ENA; 28-128N) triggered a strong Atlantic meridional mode event. During its peak in April-May, SSTs in the ENA were 1°C colder than normal and SSTs in the equatorial South Atlantic (5°S-0°) were 0.5°C warmer than normal. Associated with the SST gradient were anomalous northerly winds, an anomalous southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone, and severe flooding in Northeast Brazil. This study uses in situ and satellite observations to examine the mechanisms responsible for the anomalous cooling in the ENA during boreal winter and spring of 2009. It is found that the cooling was initiated by stronger than normal trade winds during January and February 2009 associated with an anomalous strengthening of the subtropical North Atlantic high pressure system. Between 68 and 128N, unusually strong trade winds cooled the ocean through wind-induced evaporation and deepened the mixed layer anomalously by 5-20 m. Closer to the equator, surface equatorial winds responded to the anomalous interhemispheric SST gradient, becoming northwesterly between the equator and 6°N. The anomalous winds drove upwelling of 0.5-1 m day^-1 during March-April, a period when there is normally weak downwelling. The associated vertical turbulent heat flux at the base of the mixed layer led to unusually cool SSTs in the central basin, further strengthening the anomalous interhemispheric SST gradient. These results emphasize the importance of mixed layer dynamics in the evolution of the meridional mode event of 2009 and the potential for positive coupled feedbacks between wind-induced upwelling and SST in the ENA. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

Different types of long Rossby waves (with the characteristic scales between 1000 and 2500 km) are identified in the western [west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR)] and eastern [east of the MAR] subbasins. Along-shore wind fluctuations and an equatorially forced coastal Kelvin wave were found to be responsible for the excitation of annual- and semiannual-propagating Rossby waves in the eastern subbasin. These waves are transmitted along a waveguide formed by the African shelf and the MAR. The speed of their propagation varies in magnitude and direction because of bottom topography and irregularity of the coastline. Unstable standing Rossby waves with annual and semiannual periods are shown in both the subbasins. All unstable waves, decaying, radiate shorter free Rossby waves propagating both westward and northwestward, with speeds of up to 10 cm/s. The standing Rossby waves are probably excited by the wind-driven Ekman pumping alone or in combination with linear and nonlinear resonance mechanisms.

   abstract = {Oceanic Kelvin waves from the equator to the West African coast are investigated in the framework of tropical Atlantic intraseasonal variability. In order to better highlight the wave propagations, a 25-95 day band-pass filter was applied to the sea surface height (SSH) product derived from the TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter and an ocean general circulation model simulation for the 1993-2000 period. In addition to equatorial eastward propagations, our analysis reveals recurrent and continuous propagations distinguishable over thousands of kilometers poleward along the coasts as far as about 10 degrees-15 degrees latitude, a novel result with altimeter data. The variance of the filtered SSH signal goes from 1 cm at the equator to 2 cm at the African coast. Estimates of the phase speed range from 1.5 to 2.1 m/s along the equator and the West African coastline. Such values are very close to those of equatorial Kelvin wave propagations, likely dominated by the first two baroclinic modes, supporting the fact that the coastal propagations are coastally trapped Kelvin waves. In order to simplify the description of these Kelvin waves, we present an intraseasonal climatology which reveals regular boreal autumn-winter equator to coast propagations. An improved description is achieved thanks to the computation of an extended empirical orthogonal function for the boreal autumn-winter propagations. Lag correlation of SSH signals allows for a twofold quantification: the phase speed and the importance of remote forcing along the coast. The remote forcing effect of intraseasonal Kelvin waves is clearly evidenced over coastal upwelling regions as far as 10 degrees-15 degrees latitude. The physical mechanism associated with the forcing of the Kelvin waves and its impacts will be investigated in a future paper.},

   abstract = {Ship-based acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) velocity measurements collected by several major field programs in the tropical Atlantic are averaged and combined with estimates of the mean near-surface velocity derived from drifters and Argo float surface drifts (ADCP?D) to describe the mean cross-equatorial and vertical structure of the meridional currents along 23?W and 10?W. Data from moored ADCPs and fixed-depth current meters, a satellite-derived velocity product, and a global ocean reanalysis were additionally used to evaluate the mean ADCP?D meridional velocity. The dominant circulation features in the long-term mean ADCP+D meridional velocity in the upper 100 m are the tropical cells (TCs) located approximately between 5?S and 5?N, with near-surface poleward flow and subsurface equator- ward flow that is stronger and shallower in the northern cell compared to the southern cell. The thickness of the surface limb of the TCs decreases and the northern cell is found to shift further south of the equator from the central to eastern tropical Atlantic. Analysis of two-season means estimated from the ship-based ADCP, near-surface drift, and moored velocity data, as well as the simulated fields, indicates that the maximum poleward velocity in the surface limb of the TCs intensifies during December–May along 23?Wlargely due to seasonal compensation between the geostrophic and ageostrophic (or wind-driven) components of the meridi- onal velocity, whereas the maximum equatorward flow in the subsurface limb of the northern cell intensifies during June–November along both 23?W and 10?W due to the seasonality of the geostrophic meridional velocity.},

The model results compare well with the observations, and they both show that, unlike commonly assumed, the TIWs in the Atlantic exist on both sides of the equator and are generated not only in the summer but from May to January. Furthermore it is demonstrated that the Atlantic TIWs are generated by barotropic instability of the shear between the equatorial undercurrent and the northern south equatorial current and make a surprisingly small contribution to the heat budget of the equatorial mixed layer. The model results reveal that the often published strong meridional heat flux divergence of the TIWs is largely compensated for by their vertical heat flux divergence. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Observations are used to develop metrics for interannual tropical instability wave (TIW) variability in the Atlantic and to relate that variability to larger scale processes. The analysis is partitioned into different latitude bands to distinguish between off-equatorial (5°S, 2°N, and 5°N) and near-equatorial (2°S and 0°) TIWs. TIW metrics based on sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level anomaly (SLA) fluctuations are compared against interannual anomalies of SST in the cold tongue region. To examine the role of barotropic shear instabilities in modulating the intensity of a TIW season, wind stress and near-surface current indices are developed in regions where the shear between the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) and the northern branch of the South Equatorial Current (nSEC) and between the nSEC and the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) are expected to be largest. Good agreement is found between the SST and SLA TIW metrics along the off-equatorial latitude bands, and interannual variations of both metrics can largely be attributed to barotropic shear instabilities. In particular, years with low (high) TIW variance along the off-equatorial latitude bands are associated with anomalously warm (cold) SSTs in the cold tongue region, weak (strong) wind stress divergence and curl in the EUC-nSEC region, and weak (strong) zonal current shear in the nSEC-NECC region. In contrast, in the near-equatorial latitude bands, poor agreement is found between interannual TIW activity based on the SST and SLA metrics, and near-equatorial TIW variability cannot be explained by the large-scale SST, wind stress divergence and curl, and current shear indices.

Coherent ocean-atmosphere patterns are shown during these 8 years. Southeasterly trades strengthen and water vapor increases over warm SST anomalies associated with TIWs. The opposite is true over cold TIW SST anomalies. The cloud liquid water and rain response to the SSTs follows a similar pattern, appearing generally downstream of SST anomalies in the central tropical Atlantic. The atmospheric response to the TIW SST anomalies extends north of the TIW active region, suggesting a remote response to the TIWs. The atmospheric response to the Atlantic TIWs also exhibits interannual variations. In 1999, owing to the southward movement of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the rainfall response to the TIW SST anomalies is much larger than in other years. When the Atlantic ITCZ moves south, it is more susceptible to TIW influence.},

   abstract = {Abstract Five to nine years of observations from the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean array in the tropical Pacific are used to document the seasonal cycle of surface winds, zonal currents, SST, thermocline depth, and dynamic height. Along the equator, the normally westward surface zonal current reverses direction in late boreal spring and early summer. This seasonal variation in the zonal surface current propagates westward, as do seasonal variations in the Equatorial Undercurrent and zonal surface winds at the equator. At 5°N and 5°S, the seasonal variations in the 20°C isotherm and dynamic height also propagate westward. Conversely at the equator in the eastern and central Pacific, the variations in 20°C isotherm depth and dynamic height propagate eastward. These seasonal variations are interpreted by means of a simple dynamical model based on linear equatorial wave theory. Model results indicate that seasonal variability between 5°N and 5°S is dominated by wind-forced equatorial Kelvin waves and first meridional mode Rossby waves of the first and second baroclinic modes. The sum of the Rossby waves and Kelvin waves results in westward propagation in the equatorial zonal currents and off-equatorial thermal structure and, yet, eastward propagation in thermocline depth and dynamic height along the equator in the eastern and central Pacific.},

The easterly winds in the western equatorial Atlantic during boreal spring that represent the precondi- tioning of cold/warm events were strong/weak during 2005/2008 and associated with strong/weak boreal summer EUC transport. The anomalous year 2009 was instead associated with weak preconditioning and smallest EUC transport on record from January to July, but during August coldest SST anomalies in the eastern equatorial Atlantic were observed.

It is found that seasonal variations of the BLT exert a considerable influence on SST through their modulation of the vertical heat flux at the base of the mixed layer, estimated as the residual in the mixed layer heat balance. Cooling associated with this term is strongest when the barrier layer is thin and the vertical temperature gradient at the base of the mixed layer is strong. Conversely, thick barrier layers are associated with a significant reduction in the vertical temperature gradient at the base of the mixed layer, which suppresses the upward transfer of cooler water into the mixed layer. Forced ocean and coupled ocean– atmosphere models that do not properly simulate the barrier layer may have difficulty reproducing the observed seasonal cycle of SST in the tropical North Atlantic.},

   abstract = {Since the TOGA program, and in particular the maintenance of its observing system in the tropical Pacific, significant progress has been made in the understanding of ENSO. ENSO has been viewed as a self-sustained and naturally oscillatory mode or a stable mode triggered by stochastic forcing. Whatever the case, El Niño involves Bjerknes' positive ocean-atmosphere feedback that culminates with warm SST anomalies in the equatorial eastern and central Pacific. After an El Niño reaches its mature phase, negative feedbacks are required to terminate the growth of warm SST anomalies. Four major negative feedbacks have been proposed: wave reflection at the ocean western boundary, a discharge process due to Sverdrup transport, a western Pacific wind-forced Kelvin wave of opposite sign, and anomalous zonal advection. These negative feedbacks may work in varying combinations to terminate El Niño, and reverse it into La Niña. The seasonal cycle can contribute to the irregularity and phase-locking of ENSO, and the intraseasonal variability can be a source of both ENSO's variability and irregularity. Tropical Pacific decadal-multidecadal variability and warming trends may modulate ENSO. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain tropical Pacific decadal-multidecadal variability, and they are categorized by their tropical origins and tropical-extratropical connections. Mechanisms of tropical origins include stochastic forcing, interactions between the seasonal and interannual cycles, internal nonlinearity, asymmetry between El Niño and La Niña, and local oceanatmosphere interaction, while those of tropical-extratropical connections involve oceanic bridges, wave propagation, and atmospheric bridges. Difficulties and uncertainties of studies on low-frequency variability and interpretation of warming trends, global warming, and ENSO are also discussed.},

The key to this atmosphere–ocean interaction is a positive feedback between the surface winds and the local SST gradients in the cold tongue/ITCZ complex regions, which leads to an instability in the coupled system. By means of linear instability analyses and numerical model experiments, such an instability mechanism is explored in a simple coupled ocean-atmosphere system. The instability analysis yields a family of antisymmetric and symmetric unstable SST modes. The antisymmetric mode has the most rapid growth rate. The most unstable antisymmetric mode occurs at zero wavenumber and has zero frequency. The symmetric SST mode, although its growth rate is smaller, has a structure at annual period that appears to resemble the observed westward propagating feature in the annual cycle of near-equa...},

In the control simulation, SST is globally prescribed in its full climatological seasonal cycle, while in the second simulation, equatorial Atlantic SST is held constant in time from 15 April onward.Comparison of these simulations indicates that the equatorial cooling exerts a significant influence on the African monsoon, intensifying the southerly winds in the Gulf of Guinea and pushing the continental rainband inland away from the Guinean coast. The intensification of the cross-equatorial southerlies associated with the onset of the African monsoon, in turn, triggers the oceanic cooling in the east. The equatorial easterlies are also important for the seasonal cooling by inducing local upwelling and raising the thermocline in the east.Three mechanisms are identified for the easterly wind acceleration in the equatorial Atlantic in boreal summer. First, the monsoon rainfall distribution is such that it induces zonal sea level pressure gradients and easterly anomalies in the eastern Atlantic. Second, the strong cross-equatorial southerlies advect the easterly momentum from the south into the equator. Finally, zonal pressure gradients associated with the equatorial ocean cooling accelerate surface easterly winds in the middle and western Atlantic. This interaction of equatorial SST and zonal wind causes their westward copropagation, analogous to that in the equatorial Pacific.},

The bulk of the northward warm water flow follows the coast in the North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC) from latitudes south of 10S, carrying 23 Sv (Sv  106 m3 s1 ) above 1000 m. Out of this, 16 Sv are waters warmer than 7C that form the source waters of the Florida Current. Zonal inflow from the east by the South Equatorial Current enters the western boundary system dominantly north of 5S, adding transport northwest of Cape San Roque, and transforming the NBUC along its way toward the equator into a surface-intensified current, the North Brazil Current (NBC). From the combination of moored arrays and shipboard sections just north of the equator along 44W, the mean NBC transport was determined at 35 Sv with a small seasonal cycle amplitude of only about 3 Sv. The reason for the much larger near-equatorial northward warm water boundary current than what would be required to carry the northward heat transport are recirculations by the zonal current system and the existence of the shallow South Atlantic tropical–subtropical cell (STC). The STC connects the subduction zones of the eastern subtropics of both hemispheres via equatorward boundary undercurrents with the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), and the return flow is through upwelling and poleward Ekman transport. The persistent existence of a set of eastward thermocline and intermediate countercurrents on both sides of the equator was confirmed that recurred throughout the observations and carry ventilated waters from the boundary regime into the tropical interior. A strong westward current underneath the EUC, the Equatorial Intermediate Current, returns low-oxygen water westward. Consistent evidence for the existence of a seasonal variation in the warm water flow south of the equator could not be established, whereas significant seasonal variability of the boundary regime occurs north of the equator: northwestward alongshore throughflow of about 10 Sv of waters with properties from the Southern Hemisphere was found along the Guiana boundary in boreal spring when the North Equatorial Countercurrent is absent or even flowing westward, whereas during June– January the upper NBC is known to connect with the eastward North Equatorial Countercurrent through a retroflection zone that seasonally migrates up and down the coast and spawns eddies. The equatorial zone thus acts as a buffer and transformation zone for cross-equatorial exchanges, but knowledge of the detailed pathways in the interior including the involved diapycnal exchanges is still a problem.},

Compared to the subtropical gyres the tropical circulation shows several zonal current and countercurrent bands of smaller meridional and vertical extent. The wind-driven Ekman layer in the upper tens of meters of the ocean masks at some places the flow structure of the Tropical Surface Water layer as is the case for the Angola Gyre in the eastern tropical South Atlantic. Although there are regions with a strong seasonal cycle of the Tropical Surface Water circulation, such as the North Equatorial Countercurrent, large regions of the tropics do not show a significant seasonal cycle. In the Central Water layer below, the eastward North and South Equatorial undercurrents appear imbedded in the westward-flowing South Equatorial Current. The Antarcic Intermediate Water layer contains several zonal current bands south of 3°N, but only weak flow exists north of 3°N. The sparse available data suggest that the Equatorial Intermediate Current as well as the Southern and Northern Intermediate Countercurrents extend zonally across the entire equatorial basin. Due to the convergence of northern and southern water masses, the western tropical Atlantic north of the equator is an important site for the mixture of water masses, but more work is needed to better understand the role of the various zonal under- and countercurrents in cross-equatorial water mass transfer.},

   abstract = {The effects of tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies on atmospheric circulation are examined by analyzing several ensembles of integrations of an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) forced with differently configured SSTs. An attempt is made to separate the atmospheric response to local SST forcing from internal atmospheric variability, using various statistical analyses. The analyses reveal a robust pattern of atmospheric response to SST forcing. The dominant response is largely confined within the tropical Atlantic sector and may be associated with the variation in location and intensity of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in response to changes in SST gradient near the equator. Within the deep Tropics, particularly in the western tropical Atlantic warm pool region, there is an indication of a positive feedback between surface heat flux and SST anomalies. In this warm SST region, the latent hear flux tends to dominate surface heat flux variability, and the positive feedback takes place between the wind-induced Aux and SST. Outside the deep Tropics, surface heal flux generally tends to dampen the SST, indicating a negative feedback. A strong negative feedback is found off the coast of west Saharan Africa, where the mean SST is cold and the surface heat Bur variability is largely induced by the air-sea temperature difference. The forced response exhibits a seasonal dependence. The structure throughout the year bears a close resemblance to the winter pattern, suggesting that the anomalies during the boreal winter contribute to much of the year-to-year variability in the tropical Atlantic sector. An ENSO-like response in the tropical Atlantic is also identified. It appears as the second dominant forced response and has its strongest manifestation during the boreal fall. By comparing the responses of different sets of ensemble experiments, it is found that the dominant near-surface atmospheric response in the tropical Atlantic sector primarily comes from the local SST forcing. A significant remote influence of the Pacific ENSO on the tropical Atlantic variability is also noted. The strongest remote influence from the tropical Pacific occurs during the boreal spring. The companion paper by Saravanan and Chang further explores the effect of ENSO using an index-based regression analysis.},

   abstract = {This chapter reviews the progress made in the past decade in understanding tropical Atlantic climate variability. In addition to an equatorially anti-symmetric seasonal cycle forced directly by the seasonal march of the sun, Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) displays a pronounced annual cycle on the equator that results from continental monsoon forcing and air-sea interaction. This cycle interacts with and regulates the meridional excursions of the Atlantic intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). On interannual timescales, there is an equatorial mode of variability that is similar to El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific. This Atlantic Nino is most pronounced in boreal summer coinciding with the seasonal development of the equatorial cold tongue. In boreal winter, both ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation exert a strong influence on the northeast trades and SST over the northern tropical Atlantic. In boreal spring when the equatorial Atlantic is uniformly warm, anomalies of cross-equatorial SST gradient and the ITCZ are closely coupled, resulting in anomalous rainfall over northeastern Brazil. There is evidence for a positive air-sea feedback through windinduced surface evaporation that organizes off-equatorial SST anomalies to maximize their cross-equatorial gradient. The resultant anomalous shift of the ITCZ may affect the North Atlantic Oscillation, helping to organize oceanatmospheric anomalies into a pan-Atlantic pattern.},

   abstract = {Abstract. Ocean observations are analysed in the framework of Collaborative Research Center 754 (SFB 754) "Climate-Biogeochemistry Interactions in the Tropical Ocean" to study (1) the structure of tropical oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), (2) the processes that contribute to the oxygen budget, and (3) long-term changes in the oxygen distribution. The OMZ of the eastern tropical North Atlantic (ETNA), located between the well-ventilated subtropical gyre and the equatorial oxygen maximum, is composed of a deep OMZ at about 400 m in depth with its core region centred at about 20° W, 10° N and a shallow OMZ at about 100 m in depth, with the lowest oxygen concentrations in proximity to the coastal upwelling region off Mauritania and Senegal. The oxygen budget of the deep OMZ is given by oxygen consumption mainly balanced by the oxygen supply due to meridional eddy fluxes (about 60%) and vertical mixing (about 20%, locally up to 30%). Advection by zonal jets is crucial for the establishment of the equatorial oxygen maximum. In the latitude range of the deep OMZ, it dominates the oxygen supply in the upper 300 to 400 m and generates the intermediate oxygen maximum between deep and shallow OMZs. Water mass ages from transient tracers indicate substantially older water masses in the core of the deep OMZ (about 120–180 years) compared to regions north and south of it. The deoxygenation of the ETNA OMZ during recent decades suggests a substantial imbalance in the oxygen budget: about 10% of the oxygen consumption during that period was not balanced by ventilation. Long-term oxygen observations show variability on interannual, decadal and multidecadal timescales that can partly be attributed to circulation changes. In comparison to the ETNA OMZ, the eastern tropical South Pacific OMZ shows a similar structure, including an equatorial oxygen maximum driven by zonal advection but overall much lower oxygen concentrations approaching zero in extended regions. As the shape of the OMZs is set by ocean circulation, the widespread misrepresentation of the intermediate circulation in ocean circulation models substantially contributes to their oxygen bias, which might have significant impacts on predictions of future oxygen levels.},

   abstract = {Abrupt changes in the African monsoon can have pronounced socioeconomic impacts on many West African countries. Evidence for both prolonged humid periods and monsoon failures have been identified throughout the late Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs(1,2). In particular, drought conditions in West Africa have occurred during periods of reduced North Atlantic thermohaline circulation, such as the Younger Dryas cold event(1). Here, we use an ocean-atmosphere general circulation model to examine the link between oceanographic changes in the North Atlantic Ocean and changes in the strength of the African monsoon. Our simulations show that when North Atlantic thermohaline circulation is substantially weakened, the flow of the subsurface North Brazil Current reverses. This leads to decreased upper tropical ocean stratification and warmer sea surface temperatures in the equatorial South Atlantic Ocean, and consequently reduces African summer monsoonal winds and rainfall over West Africa. This mechanism is in agreement with reconstructions of past climate. We therefore suggest that the interaction between thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean and wind-driven currents in the tropical Atlantic Ocean contributes to the rapidity of African monsoon transitions during abrupt climate change events.},

The first mode of a complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) decomposition of zonal geostrophic velocity in the NECC region reveals pronounced latitudinal displacements in addition to variations in current strength. While north-south migrations of the NECC are mainly captured by the real pattern, the imaginary pattern accounts for variations in its strength. Associated with these spatial patterns is prevailing propagation toward the northwest that is most pronounced northward of the mean NECC position (similar to 6 degrees N). There is evidence that the zonal propagation characteristics are consistent with long Rossby waves forced in the northeastern tropical Atlantic. The relationship between interannual NECC variations and the tropical Atlantic climate modes is investigated through regression and composite analyses. Sea surface temperature and wind stress patterns resembling the meridional and zonal modes are found for the CEOF regression. Composite analysis further shows consistent patterns for warm phases of the meridional mode and cold phases of the zonal mode; the response of the NECC to a positive meridional and negative zonal mode event may be viewed as a northward shift of its core and a current strengthening, respectively. These results support a link between the two dominant tropical Atlantic climate modes and show that the relation between interannual NECC variability and the meridional and zonal modes can primarily be regarded as a response to changes in the wind field.},

   abstract = {The time history of the Monsoon System over the Indian Ocean has been developed from ship observations and merged with the Wyrtki-Meyers Pacific Trade Wind field. The interaction of these two massive wind systems has been studied by a rather new empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis capable of detecting propagating features in the wind systems. The current study (Part I) was confined to variations within ±10° of the equator. Results show the two wind systems are strongly coupled at interannual time scales. The coupling is effected through cyclostationary pulsations and longitudinal shifts of the huge surface convergence over Indonesia. The interaction may also he thought of as the spatial expansion/contraction of the wind systems. These changes can be viewed as the transition of the Monsoon/Trade Winds between two preferred climate states. One sub-element of this apparent bimodality in the wind fields is the El Niño phenomenon. The zonal component of the combined wind fields seems to instigate the large-scale interaction noted above. Perturbations in the u-component are composed of two interesting elements. One is a traveling disturbance which moves from the Indian Ocean eastward into the Pacific, and has many features of an equatorially trapped Kelvin wave. The second is a standing wave pattern which has maxima in the Indian and western Pacific with a node over Indonesia (the Walker cell). Thew perturbations preceed El Niño events and are phase-locked to the seasonal cycle. Their time variation can be viewed as a frequency-modulated process. A quasi-biennial oscillation appears in both wind fields as a standing wave pattern with in-phase maxima off the cast coast of Africa and west cost of South America. Subsequent papers will describe the interaction of the Monsoon/Trade Winds system in the band ±30° of the equator (Part II) and, in Part III, build a mechanistic, physical picture for the results obtained in Parts I and II.},

In the core of theOMZat about 400-m depth, a highly significant oxygen decrease of about 15 μmol kg-1 is found between the two periods. During the same time interval, the salinity at the oxygen minimum increased by about 0.1. Above the core of the OMZ, within the central water layer, oxygen decreased too, but salinity changed only slightly or even decreased. The scatter in the local oxygen–salinity relations decreased from the earlier to the later period suggesting a reduced fila- mentation due to mesoscale eddies and/or zonal jets acting on the background gradients. Here it is suggested that latitudinally alternating zonal jets with observed amplitudes of a few centimeters per second in the depth range of the OMZ contribute to the ventilation of the OMZ. A conceptual model of the ventilation of the OMZis used to corroborate the hypothesis that changes in the strength of zonal jets affect mean oxygen levels in the OMZ. According to the model, a weakening of zonal jets, which is in general agreement with observed hydrographic evidences, is associated with a reduction of the mean oxygen levels that could significantly contribute to the observed deoxygenation of the North Atlantic OMZ.},

   abstract = {Previous studies have argued that the strength of the South Atlantic subtropical high pressure system, referred to as the South Atlantic anticyclone (SAA), modulates sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the eastern equatorial Atlantic. Using ocean and atmosphere reanalysis products, it is shown here that the strength of the SAA from February to May impacts the timing of the cold tongue onset and the intensity of its development in the eastern equatorial Atlantic via anomalous tropical wind power. This modulation in the timing and amplitude of seasonal cold tongue development manifests itself via SST anomalies peaking between June and August. The timing and impact of this connection is not completely symmetric for warm and cold events. For cold events, an anomalously strong SAA in February and March leads to positive wind power anomalies from February to June resulting in an early cold tongue onset and subsequent cold SST anomalies in June and July. For warm events, the anomalously weak SAA persists until May, generating negative wind power anomalies that lead to a late cold tongue onset as well as a suppression of the cold tongue development and associated warm SST anomalies. Mechanisms by which SAA-induced wind power variations south of the equator influence eastern equatorial Atlantic SST are discussed, including ocean adjustment via Rossby and Kelvin wave propagation, meridional advection, and local intraseasonal wind variations.},

   abstract = {This work analyzes seasonal heat transport in an ocean-only numerical simulation of the Indian Ocean forced by realistic seasonal winds and surface heat fluxes north of 15°S, assuming no Indonesian Throughflow. The seasonal changes in the model circulation and temperature structure are found to be overall consistent with observations, despite flaws in sea surface temperature and mixed layer depth. The simulation confirms that the reversal of the monsoons and of the associated Ekman transports plays an important role in reversing the sign of the ocean heat transport seasonally causing, in particular, the Arabian Sea's drastic annual cooling, but it suggests that, south of 10°N, deep boundary currents must reverse as well. Most of the model heat transport is carried by a deep downwelling cell during the northeast monsoon and by a shallower upwelling cell during the southwest monsoon. An analysis of the three-dimensional circulation reveals that, in boreal summer, the net -1.2 pW (1 pW = 1015 W) cross-equatorial model heat transport derives mostly from a 20 × 106 m3 s-1 northward boundary current at intermediate levels (12.5°C returned over the interior at the surface (27.5°C). In boreal winter, the net + 1 pW heat transport derives mostly from a 10 × 106 m3 s-1 northward interior surface flow (27.5°C) returned in several deep southward boundary currents (5°C). It is argued that the + pW February heat transport value is realistic and that a deep overturning cell must therefore exist, otherwise the return branch of the relatively small February Ekman transport would have to occur at a negative transport-averaged temperature. Moreover, deep downwelling during the northeast monsoon occurs in the model because of a pattern of flow convergence at intermediate levels of the Somali Current that is consistent with direct observations. An approach toward assessing the location and the role of diabatic processes (which could be responsible for too deep a penetration of the downwelling cell) is tested, and a formal decomposition of the seasonal heat transport into diabatic and adiabatic components is suggested. Representing as a function of latitude and potential temperature an equivalent streamfunction associated with diffusion appears a promising step toward quantifying such diabatic heat transports on a seasonal basis.},

The data assimilation system uses a high resolution global ocean model to extrapolate the information forward in time. The data inserted into the model currently consists only of conventional sea surface temperature observations and vertical temperature profiles. The data are inserted continuously into the model by updating the model's temperature solution every timestep. This update is created using a statistical interpolation routine applied to all data in a 30-day window centered on the present timestep. Large scale features in the sea surface temperature analyses are consistent with those from independent analyses. Subsurface fields created from the assimilation are much more realistic than those produced without the insertion of data. Furthermore, information contained in the assimilation field is shown to be retained in the model solution after the assimilation procedure is terminated. The results are encouraging but further improvements can be made.},

Observed variations of sea surface temperature are typically in the range of 0.3°–0.5°C and are linked to fluctuations in rainfall on both the African and South American continents. The authors use a numerical model to simulate the observed time series of sea surface temperature for the period 1960–1989. Based on the results, experiments are conducted to determine the relative importance of heat flux and momentum forcing. Two dominant timescales for variability of SST are identified: a decadal timescale that is controlled by latent heat flux anomalies and is primarily responsible for SST anomalies off the equator and an equatorial mode with a timescale of 2–5 years that is dominated by dynamical processes. The interhemispheric gradient of anomalous SST (the SST dipole) is primarily linked to the former process and thus results from the gradual strengthening and weak...},

To derive robust heat content (HC) variability, the ensemble-meanHCanomalies (HCA) of six state-of-the-art global ocean reanalyses for 1979–2007 are analyzed. Compared with previous studies, char- acteristic oceanic processes are distinguished through their dominant time scales. Using the ensemble em- pirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method, the HC fields are first decomposed into components with different time scales. The authors’ analysis shows that these components are associated with distinctive ocean dynamics. The high-frequency (first three) components can be characterized as the equatorial modes, whereas the low-frequency (the fifth and sixth) components are featured as the meridional modes. In between, the fourth component on the time scale of 3–4 yr demonstrates ‘‘mixed’’ characteristics of the meridional and equatorial modes because of an active transition from the predominant meridional to zonal structures on this time scale. Physically, this transition process is initiated by the discharge of the off-equatorial HCA, which is first accumulated as a part of the meridional mode, into the equatorial waveguide, which is triggered by the breakdown of the equilibrium between the cross-equatorial HC contrast and the overlying wind forcing, and results in a major heat transport through the equatorial waveguide into the southeastern tropical Atlantic. It is also shown that remote forcing from El Nin˜o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exerts important influence on the transition from the equatorial to meridional mode and may partly dictate its time scale of 3–4 yr. Therefore, the authors’ results demonstrate another mechanism of the equatorial Atlantic response to the ENSO forcing.},

It is found that equatorial zonal wind stress anomalies associated with the boreal spring meridional mode generate eastward propagating equatorial Kelvin waves in the central and eastern Atlantic Ocean, where variability associated with the Nio mode is strongest. These same wind stress anomalies force westward propagating equatorial Rossby waves that reflect at the western boundary into eastward propagating Kelvin waves during boreal spring and summer. The boundary-generated Kelvin waves are of the opposite sign to those directly forced by the winds earlier in the spring, so they tend to damp the Nio mode during boreal summer. The interaction between the boreal spring meridional mode and the summer Nio is therefore mediated by directly wind-forced equatorial Kelvin waves and the delayed negative feedback from western boundary reflections of wind-forced Rossby waves. © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Strong 7-day-period fluctuations were observed in the zonal velocity component and in temperature records at 23�W. The large temperature fluctuations near the thermocline depth suggest a vertical velocity component at the same 7-day period. The 7-day-period signals occurred in June/July simultaneously with the seasonal upwelling. The meridional velocity component presented similar spectral contents at 23�W and at 10�W. Two distinguishable quasiperiodic signals were observed in the meridional component at both locations: The first signal occurred in the spring, had a periodicity of about 14 days, was subsurface intensified, and had the characteristics of a mixed Rossby-gravity wave. The second signal occurred three times in the year (once in winter 2001&#8211;2002, another in summer, and another during fall 2002), had a periodicity of about 20 days, was strongest close to the surface, and was the result of the passage of tropical instability waves (TIWs). Satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data show the same periodicities as the meridional velocity records, and present a spatial structure in accordance with the TIW-SST signature. The summer of 2002 showed different TIW-SST patterns depending upon location, suggesting the existence of different types of TIWs. Overall, variability in the current meter data for the year 2002 was mainly due to current instabilities, except around boreal spring, where intraseasonal variability in surface winds was strongest.},

Here we use a suite of observational data, climate reanalysis products, and general circulation model simulations to reassess the factors driving the interannual variability. We show that some of the warm events can not be explained by previously identified equatorial wind stress forcing and ENSO-like dynamics. Instead, these events are driven by a mechanism in which surface wind forcing just north of the equator induces warm ocean temperature anomalies that are subsequently advected toward the equator. We find the surface wind patterns are associated with long- lived subtropical sea surface temperature anomalies and suggest they therefore reflect a link between equatorial and subtropicalAtlantic variability.},

Solutions are driven by climatological winds in a domain resembling the Pacific basin from 35°S to 55°N.

Five meridional cells contribute to the EUC in the main-run solution: north and south Subtropical Cells (STCs), north and south Tropical Cells (TCs), and an equatorial branch of the IOC. The STCs require subtropical subduction for their existence; however, their strength is determined largely by the Ekman divergence across ±18°, which are externally specified, equatorward boundaries of the subduction regions.

   abstract = {Within the eastern tropical oceans of the Atlantic and Pacific basin vast oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) exist in the depth range between 100 and 900 m. Minimum oxygen values are reached at 300-500 m depth which in the eastern Pacific become suboxic (dissolved oxygen content <4.5 mu mol kg(-1)) with dissolved oxygen concentration of less than 1 mu mol kg(-1). The OMZ of the eastern Atlantic is not suboxic and has relatively high oxygen minimum values of about 17 pmol kg-1 in the South Atlantic and more than 40 mu mol kg(-1) in the North Atlantic. About 20 (40%) of the North Pacific volume is occupied by an OMZ when using 45 mu mol kg(-1) (or 90 mu mol kg(-1), respectively) as an upper bound for OMZ oxygen concentration for ocean densities lighter than sigma(0) < 27.2 kg m(-3). The relative volumes reduce to less than half for the South Pacific (7% and 13%, respectively). The abundance of OMZs are considerably smaller (11% and 7%) for the South Atlantic and only similar to 0% and 5% for the North Atlantic. Thermal domes characterized by upward displacements of isotherms located in the northeastern Pacific and Atlantic and in the southeastern Atlantic are co-located with the centres of the OMZs. They seem not to be directly involved in the generation of the OMZs.|OMZs are a consequence of a combination of weak ocean ventilation, which supplies oxygen, and respiration, which consumes oxygen. Oxygen consumption can be approximated by the apparent oxygen utilization (AOU). However, AOU scaled with an appropriate consumption rate (aOUR) gives a time, the oxygen age. Here we derive oxygen ages using climatological AOU data and an empirical estimate of aOUR. Averaging oxygen ages for main thermocline isopycnals of the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean exhibit an exponential increase with density without an obvious signature of the OMZs. Oxygen supply originates from a surface outcrop area and can also be approximated by the turn-over time, the ratio of ocean volume to ventilating flux. The turn-over time corresponds well to the average oxygen ages for the well ventilated waters. However, in the density ranges of the suboxic OMZs the turn-over time substantially increases. This indicates that reduced ventilation in the outcrop is directly related to the existence of suboxic OMZs, but they are not obviously related to enhanced consumption indicated by the oxygen ages. The turn-over time suggests that the lower thermocline of the North Atlantic would be suboxic but at present this is compensated by the import of water from the well ventilated South Atlantic. The turn-over time approach itself is independent of details of ocean transport pathways. Instead the geographical location of the OMZ is to first order determined by: (i) the patterns of upwelling, either through Ekman or equatorial divergence, (ii) the regions of general sluggish horizontal transport at the eastern boundaries, and (iii) to a lesser extent to regions with high productivity as indicated through ocean colour data.

   abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

This article describes its main components and evaluates its quality. The adequacy of ORAS4 for the initialization of seasonal forecasts is discussed, along with the robustness of some prominent climate signals. ORAS4 has been evaluated using different metrics, including comparison with observed ocean currents, RAPID-derived transports, sea-level gauges, and GRACE- derived bottom pressure. Compared to a control ocean model simulation, ORAS4 improves the fit to observations, the interannual variability, and seasonal forecast skill.Someproblems have been identified, such as theunderestimation of meridional overturning at 26◦N,themagnitudeofwhich isshowntobe sensitive to the treatment of the coastal observations. ORAS4 shows a clear and robust shallowing trend of the Pacific Equatorial thermocline. It also shows a clear and robust nonlinear trend in the 0–700mocean heat content, consistent with other observational estimates. Some aspects of these climate signals are sensitive to the choice of sea-surface temperature product and the specification of the observation-error variances. The global sea-level trend is consistent with the altimeter estimate, but the partition into volume and mass variations is more debatable, as inferred by discrepancies in the trend between ORAS4- and GRACE-derived bottom pressure.},

   abstract = {The authors describe a 46-year global retrospective analysis of upper-ocean temperature, salinity, and currents. The analysis is an application of the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) package. SODA uses an ocean model based on Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory MOM2 physics. Assimilated data includes temperature and salinity profiles from the World Ocean Atlas-94 (MBT, XBT, CTD, and station data), as well as additional hydrography, sea surface temperature, and altimeter sea level. After reviewing the basic methodology the authors present experiments to examine the impact of trends in the wind field and model forecast bias (referred to in the engineering literature as ‘‘colored noise''). The authors believe these to be the major sources of error in the retrospective analysis. With detrended winds the analysis shows a pattern of warming in the subtropics and cooling in the Tropics and at high latitudes. Model forecast bias results partly from errors in surface forcing and partly from limitations of the model. Bias is of great concern in regions of thermocline water-mass formation. In the examples discussed here, the data assimilation has the effect of increasing production of these water masses and thus reducing bias. Additional experiments examine the relative importance of winds versus subsurface updating. These exper- iments show that in the Tropics both winds and subsurface updating contribute to analysis temperature, while in midlatitudes the variability results mainly from the effects of subsurface updating. 1.},

   abstract = {The eastern equatorial Atlantic Ocean is subject to interannual fluctuations of sea surface temperatures, with climatic impacts on the surrounding continents1–3. The dynamic mechanism underlying Atlantic temperature variability is thought to be similar to that of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the equatorial Pacific4,5, where air–sea coupling leads to a positive feedback between surface winds in the western basin, sea surface temperature in the eastern basin, and equatorial oceanic heat content. Here we use a suite of observational data, climate reanalysis products, and general circulation model simulations to reassess the factors driving the interannual variability. We show that some of the warm events can not be explained by previously identified equatorial wind stress forcing and ENSO-like dynamics. Instead, these events are driven by a mechanism in which surface wind forcing just north of the equator induces warm ocean temperature anomalies that are subsequently advected toward the equator. We find the surface wind patterns are associated with long- lived subtropical sea surface temperature anomalies and suggest they therefore reflect a link between equatorial and subtropicalAtlantic variability.},

   abstract = {From oceanographic measurements of currents and temperature used in a direct calculation, ocean heat transport at 25°N in the Atlantic Ocean was estimated to be 1.1 × 1015W. The method used is discussed and the estimate revised to 1.2 × 1015W by using more complete data. An analysis indicates that the results have an error of at most 0.3 × 1015W and that contributions due to the eddy heat flux and seasonal variation are relatively small. The variation of mean meridional volume transport with depth at 25°N has been computed; the profile leads to the estimate of transport in various temperature classes and to some conclusions concerning the mechanisms of heat flux. The freshwater flux at 25°N has been computed; within error it is zero, a result that agrees with the literature. One direct and two indirect methods of calculating oceanic heat fluxes are compared. Indirect computations of heat flux based on air-sea interaction data provide good global coverage. Computations using satellite data are subject to large errors, but improved technology could make satellites an excellent means for monitoring global radiation. The direct method appears to be the most accurate: various independent, oceanographic estimates agree well with results from the air-sea exchanges. Ocean heat transport can be determined simply and accurately given appropriate measurements. © 1982.},

   abstract = {The coupled atmosphere-ocean system in the equatorial eastern Pacific and Atlantic exhibits a distinct annual cycle that is reflected in contrasting conditions at the times of the two equinoxes. The contrasts are so strong that they dominate the annual march of zonally averaged outgoing long wave radiation for the equatorial belt. The March equinox corresponds to the warm season when the equatorial cold tongues in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic area absent. With the onset of summer monsoon convection over Colombia, Central America, and West Africa in May-June, northward surface winds strengthen over the eastern Pacific and Atlantic, the equatorial cold tongues reappear, and the marine convection shifts from the equatorial belt to the intertropical convergence zones (ITCZs) along 8 deg N. On the basis of observational evidence concerning the timing and year-to-year regularity of the surface wind changes during the development of the cold tongues, it is argued that (1) the increase in the northward surface winds in response to the onset of the northern summer monsoon may be instrumental in reestablishing the cold tongues, and (2) positive feedbacks involving both the zonal and meridional wind components contribute to the remarkable robustness of the cold tongue-ITCZs complexes in both oceans.},

The strongest oxygen minimum is located north of the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) at about 400 to 500-m depth just above the boundary between Central Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). It is shown that the NECC, the North Equatorial Undercurrent at 4 to 6_N, and a northern branch of the NECC at 8 to 10_N are the sources for oxygen-rich water supplied to the OMZ in summer and fall. Aweak eastward NECC at 200-m depth also exists in winter and spring as derived from Argo floats drifting at shallow levels. Historical oxygen data from 200-m depth confirm this seasonality showing high (low) oxygen content in summer and fall (spring) within the supply paths. Compared to the strong oxygen supply at 150 to 300-m depth, the ventilation of the OMZ at 300 to 600-m depth is weaker. Westward drainage of oxygen-poor water takes place north of the Guinea Dome, i.e., north of 10_N, most pronounced at 400 to 600-m depth. In July 2006 the total eastward transport of both NECC bands above sq = 27.1 kg m_3 at 23_W was about 13 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s_1). About half of this water volume circulates within the Guinea Dome or recirculates westward north of the Guinea Dome.},

The multiple passive tracer method is successfully applied to determine the origin regions of the Atlantic cold tongue (ACT), using 31 passive tracers. At the time of the ACT minimum in sea surface temperature, 38 ± 3% of the surface water in the central equatorial Atlantic is found to originate in the western side of the basin, with only 11 ± 2% originating in the east. Conversely, for the ACT surface cooling off the west coast of Africa, only 2 ± 1% is from the west of the Atlantic basin, with 71 ± 7% from the east. The region of the North Brazil undercurrent is found to be the most important origin region for the central Atlantic ACT region, for a 6–8 month lead time. Using the Met Office EN4 observational dataset of ocean temperatures, correlations are found between January temperatures in the North Brazil undercurrent region and both the ACT mean temperature and ACT spatial extent in July–August, significant at the 0.95 level. This suggests that the 6-month lead-time predictability of the ACT may be increased by improved knowledge of the North Brazil undercurrent temperature. Results from previous studies suggest that such increased predictability of the ACT could potentially help improve predictions of the West African monsoon.},

Descriptions and interpretations of surface, pycnocline, intermediate and deep waters in the region are reviewed. Spatial and temporal patterns are discussed using (1) maps of surface temperature, salinity, and nutrients (phosphate, silicate, nitrate and nitrite), and thermocline and mixed layer parameters, and (2) meridional and zonal sections of temperature, salinity, potential density, oxygen, and nutrients. These patterns were derived from World Ocean Database observations by an ocean interpolation algorithm: loess-weighted observations were projected onto quadratic functions of spatial coordinates while simultaneously fitting annual and semiannual harmonics and the Southern Oscillation Index to account for interannual variability. Contrasts between the equatorial cold tongue and the eastern Pacific warm pool are evident in all the hydrographic parameters. Annual cycles and ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) variability are of similar amplitude in the eastern tropical Pacific, however, there are important regional differences in relative variability at these time scales. Unique characteristics of the eastern tropical Pacific are discussed: the strong and shallow pycnocline, the pronounced oxygen minimum layer, and the Costa Rica Dome.

Particular focus is on multi-decadal trends and interannual variability at 26.5◦N and 45◦N. For four of the six reanalysis products, corresponding reference simulations obtained from the same models and forcing datasets but without the imposition of subsurface data constraints are included for comparison. An emphasis is placed on identifying general characteristics of the reanalysis representation of AMOC relative to their reference simulations without subsurface data constraints. The AMOC as simulated in these two sets are presented in the context of results from the Coordinated Ocean- ice Reference Experiments phase II (CORE-II) effort, wherein a common interannually varying atmospheric forcing data set was used to force a large and diverse set of global ocean-ice models. Relative to the reference simulations and CORE-II forced model simulations it is shown that i) the reanalysis products tend to have greater AMOC mean strength and enhanced variance and ii) the reanalysis products are less consistent in their year-to-year AMOC changes. We also find that relative to the reference simulations (but not the CORE-II forced model simulations) the reanalysis products tend to have enhanced multi-decadal trends (from 1975-1995 and 1995-2007) in the mid to high latitudes of the northern hemisphere.},

The work is distinguished from most existing literature in that direct estimates of zonal velocity are combined with contemporaneous temperature and salinity data, allowing trans-Pacific estimates of near-equatorial current transports and properties, including those of the northern branch of the South Equatorial Current, the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent, and the Equatorial Undercurrent. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here we assess the oxygen budget in a global biogeochemical circulation model, focusing on the Atlantic Ocean. While a coarse (0.5°) configuration displays the common bias of too large and too intense OMZs, the oxygen concentration in an eddying (0.1°) configuration is higher and closer to observations. This improvement is traced to a stronger oxygen supply by a more realistic representation of the equatorial and off-equatorial undercurrents, outweighing the concurrent increase in oxygen consumption associated with the stronger nutrient supply. The sensitivity of the eastern tropical Atlantic oxygen budget to the equatorial current intensity suggests that temporal changes in the eastward oxygen transport from thewell-oxygenated western boundary regionmight partly explain variations in the OMZs.},

   abstract = {For the eastern tropical Atlantic two recurring El Niño-like phenomena with high interannual SST anomalies have been described, one centered in the equatorial region as part of the Atlantic zonal mode and one off Angola referred to as Benguela Niño. Both events are supposed to be generated not locally but by a relaxation of the trade winds in the western equatorial Atlantic. Here the connection between SST variations in the two regions is investigated with observational data sets as well as ocean model simulations. They are correlated to such an extent that joint events should rather be viewed as one Atlantic Niño. An intriguing feature, counterintuitive in view of the remote forcing mechanism, is that SST anomalies off Angola precede those in the equatorial Atlantic. We show this behavior to be related to the difference in thermocline depths and a different seasonality of interannual SST variability in the two regions. While Benguela Niños peak in austral fall due to the Angola Benguela Front being located furthest to the south and high interannual variability in coastal Kelvin wave activity, warm events at the equator are phase-locked to austral winter when the thermocline is shallow. Perturbation experiments confirm the importance of remote forcing from the equator for SST variability off Angola and demonstrate the leading role of wind stress in the generation of SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Atlantic. These wind stress variations are shown to be linked to fluctuations in the strength of the South Atlantic Anticyclone, a connection that might be important with respect to the predictability of Atlantic Niños.},

The physical mechanisms responsible for these fluctuations are poorly understood. Some theories ascribe a central role to the wind-driven meridional overturning circulation between the tropical and subtropical oceans. Here we show, from observations over the past 50 years, that this overturning circulation has been slowing down since the 1970s, causing a decrease in upwelling of about 25\{%\} in an equatorial strip between 9V N and 9V S. This reduction in equatorial upwelling of relatively cool water, from 47 *10\{^\}6 to 35*10\{^\}6 m\{^\}3/s, is associated with a rise in equatorial sea surface temperatures of about 0.8 degrees C. Another effect of the slowing circulation is a reduction in the outgassing of CO2 from the equatorial Pacific Ocean-- at present the largest oceanic source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.},

Here we use a suite of observational data, climate reanalysis products, and general circulation model simulations to reassess the factors driving the interannual variability. We show that some of the warm events can not be explained by previously identified equatorial wind stress forcing and ENSO-like dynamics. Instead, these events are driven by a mechanism in which surface wind forcing just north of the equator induces warm ocean temperature anomalies that are subsequently advected toward the equator. We find the surface wind patterns are associated with long- lived subtropical sea surface temperature anomalies and suggest they therefore reflect a link between equatorial and subtropicalAtlantic variability.},

However, the relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the eastern equatorial Pacific and Atlantic is inconsistent, with El Niño events followed sometimes by warm and other times by cold boreal summer anomalies in the Atlantic cold tongue region. Using observational data and a hindcast simulation of the Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean (NEMO) global model at 0.5° resolution (NEMO-ORCA05), this inconsistent SST relationship is shown to be at least partly attributable to a delayed negative feedback in the tropical Atlantic that is active in years with a warm or neutral response in the eastern equatorial Atlantic. In these years, the boreal spring warming in the northern tropical Atlantic that is a typical response to El Niño is pronounced, setting up a strong meridional SST gra...},

The new reanalysis assimilates all available hydrographic and sea surface temperature data into a model of the global ocean forced with surface boundary conditions from an atmospheric reanalysis that also covers the period from 1871 through 2008. Using traditional measures of El Niño, our reanalysis shows that the timing of El Niño events is in agreement with sea surface temperature reconstructions, but El Niño in the reanalysis is stronger, particularly from 1871 to 1920. A new index based on the first moment of the temperature anomaly is introduced. The new index is used to characterize the strength and location of El Niño events and has the advantage that it is independent of the location of El Niño. Using the new index, El Niño in the reanalysis shows prominent decadal variability of strength but relatively little long‐ term trend. El Niño events were strong in the last part of the 19th century and first part of the 20th century and again in the latter part of the 20th century, with weak El Niño events in the middle of the 20th century. The location of El Niño also varies considerably, ranging from the western to the eastern Pacific near the coast of South America. However, the null hypothesis that the location of El Niño can be represented as a random distribution about a central longitude of about 140°W cannot be rejected.},

The annual-mean fields exhibit narrow zonal jets, typically 4-5° wide at the sea surface and only 2° at the subsurface levels, with directions alternating in latitude and maximum speeds about 0.5ms-1at the surface, 0.1ms-1at CW and uNADW, and 0.03ms-1at AAIW. The available data also allows us to explore the seasonal variability of these jets at the surface and AAIW levels. The surface currents are dominated by an annual cycle between 4°N and 10°N and, to a lesser degree, by a semi-annual contribution close to the equator. This variability is an outcome of evolving zonal recirculations, with the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) arising from the diversion of the northern branch of the South Equatorial Current (nSEC); the diversion begins in the eastern Atlantic and propagates west between April and August, following the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The AAIW current field is largely affected by westward propagating anomalies, most visible near 3°S, 0°, 3°N and 7°N, which give rise to current reversals. Annual averaging produces the illusion of more (5 instead of 3) and slower (peak values about 0.03ms-1instead of 0.1ms-1) jets than found on any month.},

TMI SSTs are calculated using a radiative transfer-based retrieval algorithm, which precisely accounts for SST and wind effects on surface emissivity as well as atmospheric effects on brightness temperatures. TMI SSTs are compared to 4 years of the National Data Buoy Center, Tropical Atmosphere Ocean/Triangle Trans-Ocean Buoy Network (TAO/TRITON), and Pilot Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) moored buoy in situ SSTs. The microwave SSTs are shown to have a mean bias of −0.07°C and a standard deviation of 0.57°C when compared to the TAO/TRITON and PIRATA SSTs. A discussion of time series and dependencies of the accuracy of the TMI SSTs in the presence of varying wind, cloud, and water vapor for each of the buoy arrays is presented. TRMM's precessing equatorial orbit allows the diurnal variability to be determined, revealing midafternoon warming of the surface layer at wind speeds less than 6 m s−1. Low-wind TAO/TRITON collocations show diurnal warming in both the TMI and buoy retrievals, with TMI's diurnal peak larger and 1 hour before the buoy peak. This decoupling of the skin-bulk SSTs results in larger standard deviations for daytime low-wind situations. This result has direct implications for future in situ validation studies, in situ-based regression algorithms, and future blended infrared/microwave/in situ SST products.},

   abstract = {An ocean GCM is used for idealized studies of the Atlantic circulation in a square basin. The subtropical, the tropical, and the equatorial gyres are produced by forcing the model with a wind stress profile having only latitudinal dependence. The goal is to understand the effect of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) on the Atlantic intergyre exchanges. The MOC is imposed by prescribing an inflow all along the southern boundary and an outflow at the northern boundary. The results indicate that the northward flow of the MOC has a crucial effect on the subtropical-tropical pathways. In this idealized configuration the North Atlantic wind field creates a basinwide potential vorticity barrier. Therefore, the water subducted in the North Atlantic has to flow to the western boundary before turning equatorward. This is shown by the trajectories of floats injected in a band of northern latitudes. The warm water return flow of the MOC inhibits this pathway and reduces the inflow of North Atlantic waters into the equator from 10 Sv in the purely wind-driven case to 2 Sv (Sv = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)). Thus, the equatorial thermocline consists mainly of water from the South Atlantic. The analysis of synthetic float trajectories reveals two distinct routes for the return flow of the MOC, the first one occurring in the intermediate layers along the western boundary and the second all across the basin in the surface layer. The surface path starts with water subducting in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre, flowing within the North Brazil Current to the equator, entering the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), becoming entrained into the tropical mixed layer, and finally flowing northward in the Ekman layer. The contribution of thermocline water to the MOC return flow is negligible.},

   abstract = {Flathead grey mullets Mugil cephalus are commonly found in Mediterranean lagoons, which are regularly subject to high environmental variations. Oxygen is one of the factors that shows extremely high variation. The objective of this study was to test the effects of acute hypoxia exposure at two experimental temperatures (i.e. 20 and 30 degrees C) on the stamina (time to fatigue) in M. cephalus swimming at the minimal cost of transport (i.e. optimal swimming speed; U (opt)). At each temperature, a relationship was established between swimming speed and oxygen consumption (MO2). This allowed estimation of U (opt) at 45 cm s(-1) (similar to 1.12 Body Length s(-1)). Independent of temperature, stamina at U-opt was significantly reduced in severe hypoxia, i.e. at 15% of air saturation (AS). In these conditions, oxygen supply appears therefore to be insufficient to maintain swimming, even at the low speed tested here. After the stamina test, MO2 measured in fish tested at 15% AS was significantly higher than that measured after the test in normoxia. Therefore, we suggest that in hypoxia, fish used anaerobic metabolism to supplement swimming at U-opt, leading to an oxygen debt. Since flathead grey mullet is a hypoxia-tolerant species, it is possible that hypoxic conditions less severe than those tested here may reduce stamina at low speed in less tolerant species. In addition, we suggest that testing stamina at these speeds may be relevant in order to understand the effect of hypoxia on behavioural activities carried out at low speed, such as food searching.},

The tropical low oxygen zones have expanded horizontally and vertically. Subsurface oxygen has decreased adjacent to most continental shelves. However, oxygen has increased in some regions in the subtropical gyres at the depths analyzed. According to literature discussed below, fishing pressure is strong in the open ocean, which may make it difficult to isolate the impact of declining oxygen on fisheries. At shallower depths we predict habitat compression will occur for hypoxia-intolerant taxa, with eventual loss of biodiversity. Should past trends in observed oxygen differences continue into the future, shifts in animal distributions and changes in ecosystem structure could accelerate. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Ocean warming and increased stratification of the upper ocean caused by global climate change will likely lead to declines in dissolved O2 in the ocean interior (ocean deoxygenation) with implications for ocean productivity, nutrient cycling, carbon cycling, and marine habitat. Ocean models predict declines of 1 to 7% in the global ocean O2 inventory over the next century, with declines continuing for a thousand years or more into the future. An important consequence may be an expansion in the area and volume of so-called oxygen minimum zones, where O2 levels are too low to support many macrofauna and profound changes in biogeochemical cycling occur. Significant deoxygenation has occurred over the past 50 years in the North Pacific and tropical oceans, suggesting larger changes are looming. The potential for larger O2 declines in the future suggests the need for an improved observing system for tracking ocean 02 changes.},

   abstract = {Observations and model runs indicate trends in dissolved oxygen (DO) associated with current and ongoing global warming. However, a large-scale observation-tomodel comparison has been missing and is presented here. This study presents a first global compilation of DO measurements covering the last 50 yr. It shows declining upperocean DO levels in many regions, especially the tropical oceans, whereas areas with increasing trends are found in the subtropics and in some subpolar regions. For the Atlantic Ocean south of 20 N, the DO history could even be extended back to about 70 yr, showing decreasing DO in the subtropical South Atlantic. The global mean DO trend between 50 S and 50 N at 300 dbar for the period 1960 to 2010 is −0.066 μmol kg−1 yr−1. Results of a numerical biogeochemical Earth system model reveal that the magnitude of the observed change is consistent with CO2-induced climate change. However, the pattern correlation between simulated and observed patterns of past DO change is negative, indicating that the model does not correctly reproduce the processes responsible for observed regional oxygen changes in the past 50 yr. A negative pattern correlation is also obtained for model configurations with particularly low and particularly high diapycnal mixing, for a configuration that assumes a CO2-induced enhancement of the C :N ratios of exported organic matter and irrespective of whether climatological or realistic winds from reanalysis products are used to force the model. Depending on the model configuration the 300 dbar DO trend between 50 S and 50 N is −0.027 to −0.047 μmol kg−1 yr−1 for climatological wind forcing, with a much larger range of −0.083 to +0.027 μmol kg−1 yr−1 for different initializations of sensitivity runs with reanalysis wind forcing. Although numerical models reproduce the overall sign and, to some extent, magnitude of observed ocean deoxygenation, this degree of realism does not necessarily apply to simulated regional patterns and the representation of processes involved in their generation. Further analysis of the processes that can explain the discrepancies between observed and modeled DO trends is required to better understand the climate sensitivity of oceanic oxygen fields and predict potential DO changes in the future.},

Here we report a new potentially significant impact on the oxygen-minimum zones of the tropical oceans. Using a model of global climate, ocean circulation, and biogeochemical cycling, we extrapolate mesocosm-derived experimental findings of a pCO2-sensitive increase in biotic carbon-to-nitrogen drawdown to the global ocean. For a simulation run from the onset of the industrial revolution until A.D. 2100 under a &#8220;business-as-usual&#8221; scenario for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, our model predicts a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 levels, which amounts to 34 Gt C by the end of this century. While this represents a small alteration of the anthropogenic perturbation of the carbon cycle, the model results reveal a dramatic 50% increase in the suboxic water volume by the end of this century in response to the respiration of excess organic carbon formed at higher CO2 levels. This is a significant expansion of the marine &#8220;dead zones&#8221; with severe implications not only for all higher life forms but also for oxygen-sensitive nutrient recycling and, hence, for oceanic nutrient inventories.},

   abstract = {Abstract. The replenishment of consumed oxygen in the open ocean oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off northwest Africa is accomplished by oxygen transport across and along density surfaces, i.e. diapycnal and isopycnal oxygen supply. Here the diapycnal oxygen supply is investigated using a large observational set of oxygen profiles and diapycnal mixing data from years 2008 to 2010. Diapycnal mixing is inferred from different sources: (i) a large-scale tracer release experiment, (ii) microstructure profiles, and (iii) shipboard acoustic current measurements plus density profiles. From these measurements, the average diapycnal diffusivity in the studied depth interval from 150 to 500 m is estimated to be 1 &times; 10&minus;5 m2 s−1, with lower and upper 95% confidence limits of 0.8 &times; 10&minus;5 m2 s−1 and 1.4 &times; 10&minus;5 m2 s−1. Diapycnal diffusivity in this depth range is predominantly caused by turbulence, and shows no significant vertical gradient. Diapycnal mixing is found to contribute substantially to the oxygen supply of the OMZ. Within the OMZ core, 1.5 &mu;mol kg−1 yr−1 of oxygen is supplied via diapycnal mixing, contributing about one-third of the total demand. This oxygen which is supplied via diapycnal mixing originates from oxygen that has been laterally supplied within the upper Central Water layer above the OMZ, and within the Antarctic Intermediate Water layer below the OMZ. Due to the existence of a separate shallow oxygen minimum at about 100 m depth throughout most of the study area, there is no net vertical oxygen flux from the surface layer into the Central Water layer. Thus all oxygen supply of the OMZ is associated with remote pathways.},

   abstract = {Coherent mesoscale features (referred to here as eddies) in the tropical northeast Atlantic (between 12–22° N and 15–26° W) are examined and characterised. The eddies' surface signatures are investigated using 19 years of satellite derived sea level anomaly (SLA) data. Two automated detection methods are applied, the geometrical method based on closed streamlines around eddy cores, and the Okubo–Weiß method based on the relation between vorticity and strain. Both methods give similar results. Mean eddy surface signatures of SLA, sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS) are obtained from composites of all snapshots around identified eddy cores. Anticyclones/cyclones are associated with elevation/depression of SLA and enhanced/reduced SST and SSS patterns. However, about 20 % of all detected anticyclones show reduced SST and reduced SSS instead. These kind of eddies are classified as anticyclonic mode-water eddies (ACMEs). About 146 ± 4 eddies per year are identified (52 % cyclones, 39 % anticylones, 9 % ACMEs) with rather similar mean radii of about 56 ± 12 km. Based on concurrent in-situ temperature and salinity profile data (from Argo float, shipboard and mooring data) inside of the three eddy types, their distinct differences in vertical structure is determined. Most eddies are generated preferentially in boreal summer and along the West African coast at three distinct coastal headland region and carry South Atlantic Central Water that originates from the northward transport within the Mauretania coastal current system. Westward eddy propagation (on average about 3.00 ± 2.15 km d−1) is confined to distinct corridors with a small meridional deflection dependent on the eddy type (anticyclones – equatorward, cyclones – poleward, ACMEs – no deflection). Heat and salt flux out of the coastal region and across the Cap Verde Frontal Zone, which separates the shadow zone from the ventilated gyre, are calculated.},

Indeed, ideas from the theory of dynamical systems have provided new ways of interpreting the information contained in climatic time series. We review the properties of several modem time series analysis methods. Those methods belong to four main classes: Fourier techniques (Blackman-Tukey and Multi-Taper), Maximum Entropy technique, Singular-spectrum techniques and wavelet analysis. Their respective advantages and limitations are illustrated by numerical experiments on synthetic time series. As climate data can be irregularly spaced in time, we also compare three interpolating methods on those time series. Those tests are aimed at showing the pitfalls of the blind use of mathematical or statistical techniques on climate data. We apply those methods to 'real' climatic data from temperature variations over the last century, and the Vostok ice core deuterium record over the last glacial cycle. Then we show how interpretations on the dynamics of climate can be derived on those time scales.},

Here the symmetry of the Atlantic Niño mode, which many previous studies have argued is governed by atmosphere-ocean dynamics similar to those of ENSO, is investigated using two different ocean reanalysis products. Calculation of Bjerknes feedback terms for the Pacific reveals a pronounced asymmetry between warm and cold events, though unlike most previous studies, the largest asymmetry is found in the relationship between eastern Pacific thermocline depth and sea surface temperature anomalies. For the Atlantic, cold events are effectively mirror images of warm events with Bjerknes feedbacks of similar strength. The analysis supports not only the conclusion that Atlantic Niños are more symmetric than ENSO but also the hypothesis itself that the Bjerknes feedback is operative in the Atlantic given the strength of the relationship between the key variables involved.},

SETTING European regions with population-based registries of children with CP. PARTICIPANTS Children (n=1174) aged 8 to 12 years were randomly selected from 8 population-based registries of children with CP in 6 European countries. Of these, 743 (63%) agreed to participate; 1 further region recruited 75 children from multiple sources. Thus, there were 818 children in the study. INTERVENTIONS Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Participation in life situations. RESULTS For the hypothesized associations, the models confirmed that higher participation was associated with better availability of environmental items. Higher participation in daily activities-mealtimes, health hygiene, personal care, and home life-was significantly associated with a better physical environment at home (P<.01). Mobility was associated with transport and physical environment in the community. Participation in social roles (responsibilities, relationships, recreation) was associated with attitudes of classmates and social support at home. School participation was associated with attitudes of teachers and therapists. Environment explained between 14% and 52% of the variation in participation. CONCLUSIONS The findings confirmed the social model of disability. The physical, social, and attitudinal environment of disabled children influences their participation in everyday activities and social roles.},

   abstract = {A hierarchy of models, varying from 2 1/2-layer to 4 1/2-layer systems, is used to explore the dynamics of the Pacific Subsurface Countercurrents, commonly referred to as "Tsuchiya Jets'' (TJs). The TJs are eastward currents located on either side of the equator at depths from 200 to 500 m and at latitudes varying from about 2degrees to 7degrees north and south of the equator, and they carry about 14 Sv of lower-thermocline (upper-intermediate) water throughout the tropical Pacific. Solutions are found in idealized and realistic basins and are obtained both analytically and numerically. They are forced by winds and by a prescribed Pacific interocean circulation (IOC) with transport M (usually 10 Sv), representing the outflow of water in the Indonesian passages and a compensating inflow from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Analytic solutions to the 2 1/2-layer model suggest that the TJs are geostrophic currents along arrested fronts. Such fronts are generated when Rossby wave characteristics, carrying information about oceanic density structure away from boundaries, converge or intersect in the interior ocean. They indicate that the southern and northern TJs are driven by upwelling along the South American coast and in the ITCZ band, respectively, that the northern TJ is strengthened by a recirculation gyre that extends across the basin, and that TJ pathways are sensitive to stratification parameters. Numerical solutions to the 2 1/2-layer and 4 1/2-layer models confirm the analytic results, demonstrate that the northern TJ is strengthened considerably by unstable waves along the eastward branch of the recirculation gyre, show that the TJs are an important branch of the Pacific IOC, and illustrate the sensitivity of TJ pathways to vertical-mixing parameterizations and the structure of the driving wind. In a solution to the 2 1/2-layer model with M = 0, the southern TJ vanishes but the northern one remains, being maintained by the unstable waves. In contrast, both TJs vanish in the M = 0 solution to the 4 1/2-layer model, apparently because wave energy can radiate into a deeper layer (i.e., layer 4). In the 4 1/2-model, then, the TJs exist because of the Indonesian Throughflow, a remarkable example of remote forcing on a basinwide scale.},

   abstract = {The Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) is the leading mode of Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) variability at multidecadal time scales. Previous studies have shown that the AMO could modulate El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variance. However, the role played by the AMO in the tropical Atlantic variability (TAV) is still uncertain. Here, it is demonstrated that during negative AMO phases, associated with a shallower thermocline, the eastern equatorial Atlantic SST variability is enhanced by more than 150% in boreal summer. Consequently, the interannual TAV modes are modified. During negative AMO, the Atlantic Nino displays larger amplitude and a westward extension and it is proceded by a simultaneous weakening of both subtropical highs in winter and spring. In contract, a meridional seasaw SLP pattern evolving into a zonal gradient leads the Atlantic Nino during positve AMO. The north tropical Atlantic (NTA) mode is related to a Scandinavian blocking pattern during winter and spring in negative AMO, while under positive AMO it is part of the SST tripole associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation. Interestingly, the emergence of an overlooked variability mode, here called the horseshoe (HS) pattern on account of its shape, is favored during negative AMO. This anomalous warm (cool) HS surrounding an eastern equatorial cooling (warming) is remotely forced by an ENSO phenomenon. During negative AMO, the tropical-extropical teleconnections are enhanced and the Walker circulation is altered. This, together with the increased equatorial SST variability, could promote the ENSO impacts on TAV. The results herein give a step forward in better understanding of TAV, which is essential to improving its modeling, impacts, and predictability.},

   abstract = {The flow of wave energy in stationary, two-dimensional gravity waves of small amplitude in a basic current where the velocity and stability varies with height, is studied. The vertical flux of wave energy is found to vary with height in proportion to the wind speed. In layers where the wave motion of a particular wave length is of the internal type, the motion may be subdivided into two parts, one wave carrying wave energy upward, and the other carrying wave energy downward. In the case of mountain waves, the wave with upward energy flow may be interpreted as the incident wave, set up by the mountain, whereas the wave carrying energy downward is caused by reflection of the incident wave in higher layers in the atmosphere. Such reflection is generally found to take place when wind or stability varies with height. The reflection coefficients in two- and threelayer atmospheres are calculated. The results are applied to a distribution of wind and stability typical of situations in which mountain waves occur. It was found that, depending on the wave length, 65-100 per cent of the wave energy was reflected from layers of strong wind in the upper troposphere. In middle latitudes in winter, wave energy may be transmitted to the lower ionosphere. A study is also made of the energy transfer for long quasi-static mountain waves.},

FTDC 8133, FTDC 3666 and FTDC 8264 were grown. In addition, the ability of probiotics strains to grow in pineapple waste was investigated. Methods: Lactobacilli sp. were propagated in MRS broth for three successive times prior to carry out the fermentation in pineapple waste substrate using cheapest and simplest technique namely shake flask fermentation incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The effects of different temperatures and initial pH on viability of probiotics were determined spectrophotometrically at 600 nm wavelength. Results: The results showed that best growth was significantly obtained at 37°C and pH 6. Effect of the pineapple-wastes culture medium on the bacterial growth was comparable to that of MRS. Conclusion: It can be concluded that pineapple wastes from these processing industries can be utilized to produce culture medium for cultivation of probiotics bacteria whereas MRS medium which is an expensive medium for cultivating probiotics. At the same time we can use the wastes to increase the economic value of the wastes obtained after fermentation.

   abstract = {Current climate models systematically underestimate the strength of oceanic fronts associated with strong western boundary currents, such as the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream Extensions, and have difficulty simulating their positions at the mid-latitude ocean’s western boundaries1. Even with an enhanced grid resolution to resolve ocean mesoscale eddies—energetic circulations with horizontal scales of about a hundred kilometres that strongly interact with the fronts and currents—the bias problem can still persist2; to improve climate models we need a better understanding of the dynamics governing these oceanic frontal regimes. Yet prevailing theories about the western boundary fronts are based on ocean internal dynamics without taking into consideration the intense air–sea feedbacks in these oceanic frontal regions. Here, by focusing on the Kuroshio Extension Jet east of Japan as the direct continuation of the Kuroshio, we show that feedback between ocean mesoscale eddies and the atmosphere (OME-A) is fundamental to the dynamics and control of these energetic currents. Suppressing OME-A feedback in eddy-resolving coupled climate model simulations results in a 20–40 per cent weakening in the Kuroshio Extension Jet. This is because OME-A feedback dominates eddy potential energy destruction, which dissipates more than 70 per cent of the eddy potential energy extracted from the Kuroshio Extension Jet. The absence of OME-A feedback inevitably leads to a reduction in eddy potential energy production in order to balance the energy budget, which results in a weakened mean current. The finding has important implications for improving climate models’ representation of major oceanic fronts, which are essential components in the simulation and prediction of extratropical storms and other extreme events3, 4, 5, 6, as well as in the projection of the effect on these events of climate change.},

Enhanced primary production results in an accumulation of particulate organic matter, which encourages microbial activity and the consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters.

   abstract = {An ocean GCM is used for idealized studies of the Atlantic circulation in a square basin. The subtropical, the tropical, and the equatorial gyres are produced by forcing the model with a wind stress profile having only latitudinal dependence. The goal is to understand the effect of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) on the Atlantic intergyre exchanges. The MOC is imposed by prescribing an inflow all along the southern boundary and an outflow at the northern boundary. The results indicate that the northward flow of the MOC has a crucial effect on the subtropical-tropical pathways. In this idealized configuration the North Atlantic wind field creates a basinwide potential vorticity barrier. Therefore, the water subducted in the North Atlantic has to flow to the western boundary before turning equatorward. This is shown by the trajectories of floats injected in a band of northern latitudes. The warm water return flow of the MOC inhibits this pathway and reduces the inflow of North Atlantic waters into the equator from 10 Sv in the purely wind-driven case to 2 Sv (Sv = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)). Thus, the equatorial thermocline consists mainly of water from the South Atlantic. The analysis of synthetic float trajectories reveals two distinct routes for the return flow of the MOC, the first one occurring in the intermediate layers along the western boundary and the second all across the basin in the surface layer. The surface path starts with water subducting in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre, flowing within the North Brazil Current to the equator, entering the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), becoming entrained into the tropical mixed layer, and finally flowing northward in the Ekman layer. The contribution of thermocline water to the MOC return flow is negligible.},

   abstract = {The Tsuchiya jets (TJs) are narrow eastward currents, located a few degrees on either side of the equator at depths from 200 to 500 m in the Pacific Ocean. In this study, non-eddy-resolving, oceanic general circulation models (OGCMs) are used to investigate the dynamics of the southern TJ. Most solutions are found in a rectangular basin extending 100° zonally and from 40°S to 10°N. They are forced by idealized zonal and meridional winds representing the trades and the southerly winds near the South American coast, by a prescribed interocean circulation (IOC) that enters the basin through the southern boundary and exits through the western boundary from 2° to 6°N (the model's Indonesian passages), and by surface heating that warms the ocean in the Tropics. A suite of solutions is presented to isolate effects of each forcing and mixing process. A few solutions are also found to a global OGCM driven by realistic forcings. Solutions forced by all of the aforementioned processes and with minimal diffusion resemble the observed flow field in the tropical South Pacific. A narrow eastward current, the model southern TJ, flows across the basin along the southern edge of a thick equatorial thermostad, and upwells at the eastern boundary. Its deeper part is supplied by water that leaves the western boundary current somewhat south of the equator. Its shallower part originates from water that diverges from the deep portion of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC); as a result, the TJ transport increases to the east and the TJ warms as it flows across the basin. A major part of the water that upwells at the eastern boundary is supplied by the TJ with a minor contribution from the southern boundary region. In idealized-basin solutions without forcing either by the IOC or meridional wind, the TJ is weak or absent. These, and other, properties suggest that the dynamics of the model's TJ are those of an arrested front, which in a 21/2-layer model are generated when characteristics of the flow merge or intersect. When diffusivity is increased to commonly used values, the thermostad is less well defined or even absent and the TJ is weak, suggesting that excessive diffusion is the reason why TJs are not present in many previous OGCMs. In the solution to a global OGCM, the southern TJ still exists without the IOC, although it is warmed by 1°C, indicating that much of its water is supplied by an overturning cell confined within the Pacific basin. \{©\} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

Analyses of an eddy-resolving global ocean general circulation model output reveal that the NEUC jets have a mode-1 baroclinic vertical structure and are spatially persistent on the interannual and longer time scales. This OGCM-simulated vertical structure prompts the authors to adopt the simpler, nonlinear -layer reduced-gravity model, as well as the baroclinic Rossby wave triad interaction theory, to unravel the essential processes underlying the NEUC jets. The seed for the NEUC jets originates in annual baroclinic Rossby waves driven by the large-scale surface wind stress forcing.

Inspection of the interannual boreal summer cold tongue variability revealed a warm (cold) event in 2002 (2005), with relaxed (intensified) winds in the west and the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) embedded in a shallower (deeper) thermocline at 23°W. During both years, 2002 and 2005, equatorial Kelvin waves are present in moored observations as 20°C isotherm depth anomalies and dynamic height anomalies. Basin-wide sea surface height anomalies are used to derive an equatorial Kelvin wave mode. The time evolution of this mode represents the basis for a regression analysis to investigate related oceanic variability: Compared to the exceptionally strong wave activity in 2002, equatorial Kelvin waves were generally weaker during 2005. The main effect of equatorial Kelvin waves on zonal velocity anomalies at 23°W, 0° is evident well below the EUC core. Their direct influence on cold tongue sea surface temperature is small, but they are found to affect the equatorial thermocline slope. Prior to the cold tongue onset in 2002 (2005), the presence of equatorial Kelvin waves is associated with a flattened (steeper) thermocline slope that is crucial for the shallowing (deepening) of the EUC core at 23°W and that might precondition the development of the warm (cold) event.},

   abstract = {Three versions of a 21/2-layer ocean model are used to study the subtropical cell (STC), a shallow, meridional circulation cell consisting of subtropical subduction, equatorward advection of cool subsurface water into the tropics, upwelling at the equator, and poleward advection of warm surface water back to midlatitudes. The three versions are a steady-state analytic model, a numerical model with constant layer temperatures, and a numerical model with variable layer temperatures and active thermodynamics. Two different parameterizations of mixed-layer processes are utilized to determine how water moves between the two layers. In the simpler parameterization, entrainment and detrainment rates, w(e) and w(d), are specified so that the upper-layer thickness h(1) relaxes back to an externally prescribed thickness; in the other, they are related to the surface heat flux Q. In both versions detrainment is cut off at the latitude y(d) = 18 degrees to prevent subduction from occurring in the tropics. Solutions are obtained in a rectangular basin that is symmetric about the equator. They are forced by idealized representations of observed zonal wind stress t(x) and Q fields, the latter used only for the thermodynamic model. The analytic solution provides a comprehensive, three-dimensional description of the STC and illustrates its fundamental dynamics. First, it indicates that the strength of the STC depends only on the wind stress tau(x) and Coriolis force f at the latitude y(d); it is not related to the Ekman pumping velocity (tau(x)/f)y over the subtropical ocean or to the strength of the equatorial wind field. Thus, the amount of subtropical water that upwells in the tropics is remotely forced by processes outside the tropics (along y(d)). Second, two types of water contribute roughly equally to the STC: unventilated water from the lower-layer western boundary current and ventilated water subducted in the subtropical ocean. Third, an internally determined streamline x(e)(y) determines whether the subtropical water approaches the equator entirely in the western boundary current or partly through the interior ocean. Fourth, another streamline x(b)(y) defines the western edge of the equatorward branch of the STC and thereby determines the latitude at which the westward lower-layer flow bifurcates at the western boundary. Solutions to the constant-temperature numerical model corroborate the analytic results and illustrate the nature of boundary layers. Among other things, they demonstrate that the equatorial circulation is sensitive to the equatorial wind through its influence on the location of tropical upwelling field w(e); in our control run forced with equatorial easterly winds, w(e) occurs on the equator in the eastern ocean, and the lower-layer flow field develops an equatorial undercurrent (EUC); in test solutions forced without equatorial winds, w(e) exists in an off-equatorial band across the interior ocean and there is no EUC. It follows that local forcing by equatorial winds is required for the existence of equatorial upwelling and the EUC in the control run. In the solution to the thermodynamic model, the circulation is similar to that in the control run, except that h(1) deepens markedly north of the line where Q changes sign to become negative. As a result, the total subduction in the subtropics increases by a factor of 2.1, and the source of all the water that contributes to the equatorward branch of the STC is subtropical subduction. In the tropics, the lower-layer temperature is maintained at a cool value by advection associated with the STC.},

In the eastern tropical Pacific and Atlantic, this balance creates extended oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) at intermediate depth. Here, we analyze hydrographic and velocity data from shipboard and moored observations, which were taken along the 23\{\textdegree\}W meridian cutting through the Tropical North East Atlantic (TNEA) OMZ, to study the distribution and generation of oxygen variability. By applying the extended Osborn--Cox model, the respective role of mesoscale stirring and diapycnal mixing in producing enhanced oxygen variability, found at the southern and upper boundary of the OMZ, is quantified. From the well-ventilated equatorial region toward the OMZ core a northward eddy-driven oxygen flux is observed whose divergence corresponds to an oxygen supply of about 2.4 $μ$mol kg−1 year−1 at the OMZ core depth. Above the OMZ core, mesoscale eddies act to redistribute low- and high-oxygen waters associated with westward and eastward currents, respectively. Here, absolute values of the local oxygen supply >10 $μ$mol kg−1 year−1 are found, likely balanced by mean zonal advection. Combining our results with recent studies, a refined oxygen budget for the TNEA OMZ is derived. Eddy-driven meridional oxygen supply contributes more than 50 \{%\} of the supply required to balance the estimated oxygen consumption. The oxygen tendency in the OMZ, as given by the multidecadal oxygen decline, is maximum slightly above the OMZ core and represents a substantial imbalance of the oxygen budget reaching about 20 \{%\} of the magnitude of the eddy-driven oxygen supply.},

   abstract = {The Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) is the leading mode of Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) variability at multidecadal time scales. Previous studies have shown that the AMO could modulate El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variance. However, the role played by the AMO in the tropical Atlantic variability (TAV) is still uncertain. Here, it is demonstrated that during negative AMO phases, associated with a shallower thermocline, the eastern equatorial Atlantic SST variability is enhanced by more than 150% in boreal summer. Consequently, the interannual TAV modes are modified. During negative AMO, the Atlantic Nino displays larger amplitude and a westward extension and it is proceded by a simultaneous weakening of both subtropical highs in winter and spring. In contract, a meridional seasaw SLP pattern evolving into a zonal gradient leads the Atlantic Nino during positve AMO. The north tropical Atlantic (NTA) mode is related to a Scandinavian blocking pattern during winter and spring in negative AMO, while under positive AMO it is part of the SST tripole associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation. Interestingly, the emergence of an overlooked variability mode, here called the horseshoe (HS) pattern on account of its shape, is favored during negative AMO. This anomalous warm (cool) HS surrounding an eastern equatorial cooling (warming) is remotely forced by an ENSO phenomenon. During negative AMO, the tropical-extropical teleconnections are enhanced and the Walker circulation is altered. This, together with the increased equatorial SST variability, could promote the ENSO impacts on TAV. The results herein give a step forward in better understanding of TAV, which is essential to improving its modeling, impacts, and predictability.},

The data is analyzed using complex Hilbert empirical orthogonal functions, confirming that most of the variance has annual periodicity, with maximum amplitudes in the region spanned by the seasonal displacement of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The ADT mirrors the shape of the upper isopycnals, hence becoming a good indicator of the amount of water stored in the upper ocean. Within about 3° from the Equator, where the Coriolis force is small, there is year-long meridional Ekman-transport divergence that would lead to the eastward transport of the Equatorial Undercurrent and its northern and southern branches. Beyond 3° of latitude, and at least as far as 20°, the convergence of the Ekman transport generally causes a poleward positive ADT gradient, which sustains the westward South Equatorial Current (SEC). The sole exception occurs in summer, between 8°N and 12°N, when an Ekman-transport divergence develops and depletes de amount of surface water, resulting in an ADT ridge-valley system which reverses the ADT gradient and drives the eastward North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) at latitudes 4-9°N; in late fall, divergence ceases and the NECC drains the ADT ridge, so the ADT gradient again becomes positive and the SEC reappears. The seasonal evolution of a tilted ITCZ controls the surface water fluxes: the wind-induced transports set the surface divergence-convergence, which then drive the ADT and, through the ADT gradients, create the geostrophic jets that close the water balance.},

The observations reveal an EUC with a strong semiannual pattern of intensification. Direct measurements also confirm the existence of a northern branch of the NECC (nNECC), observed here for the first time in the western tropical Atlantic. The NECC displays an annual cycle of northward migration on the basin, driven by the Sverdrup transport generated by the wind field. In this cycle the nNECC is a semipersistent feature fed by waters from the Northern Hemisphere and the residual nNECC flow from the previous year.},

Transport from ADCP measurements during four WOCE cruises and from 5-year SeaWinds scatterometer wind data (QuikSCAT satellite) were used to support model results. It is found that the NECC in the annual mean is approximately in Sverdrup balance, but that seasonal changes in the wind stress curl lead the transport expected from the Sverdrup balance by one month, the propagation time of the seasonal Rossby waves from the African coast to 35°W. An investigation of the vertical structure of the NECC shows that there is an eastward core throughout the year, but in spring it is below the westward Ekman flow. Only 60% of the total transport are above the thermocline. The most interesting result of the present study is that model as well as observations describe a distinct second, northern core of the NECC which has not yet found much attention in the literature. It is shown here that the two cores of the NECC are the direct result of the finite width of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This suggests that observational programs that try to determine the NECC transport have to cover the area up to 15°N. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Inferred from the surface current data, the NECC axis east and west of the dateline moves northward along its pathway in the latter half of a year and the first half of a year, respectively. The sea surface height anomaly in the NECC region and the meridional movement of NECC are well reproduced by a linear wind-driven first-mode baroclinic Rossby wave model. Model experiments by setting the phase speed of baroclinic Rossby wave or the Ekman pumping to zero in different regions are carried out to clarify the influence of Rossby wave and local Ekman pumping on the movement of NECC. East of the dateline, both Ekman pumping and Rossby wave are important in determining the northward movement of the NECC axis. However, the NECC axis west of the dateline moves northward primarily due to the westward transmission of positive sea surface height anomalies (or downwelling Rossby waves) that originate in the east of the dateline. The local Ekman pumping plays a minor role in controlling the migration of the NECC axis west of the dateline.},

It was preceded by a strong negative Atlantic meridional mode event associated with north-westerly wind anomalies along the equator from March to May. Although classical equatorial wave dynamics suggest that westerly wind anomalies should be followed by a warming in the eastern equatorial Atlantic, an abrupt cooling took place. In the literature two mechanisms—meridional advection of subsur- face temperature anomalies and planetary wave reflection—are discussed as potential causes of such an event. Here, for the first time we use in situ measurements in addition to satellite and reanalysis products to investigate the contribution of both mechanisms to the 2009 cold event. Our results suggest that meridio- nal advection is less important in cold events than in corresponding warm events, and, in particular, did not cause the 2009 cold event. Argo float data confirm previous findings that planetary wave reflection contrib- uted to the onset of the 2009 cold event.

However, our water mass analysis of historic hydrographic observations together with numerical Lagrangian experiments consistently reveal that the potential density level of σθ=26.8 kg m-3 (σ26.8, approximately 300 m depth) separates two distinct regimes of circulation within the Central Water (CW) stratum of the naOMZ. In the upper CW (above σ26.8), and in agreement with previous studies, the supply of water mainly comes from the south with a predominant contribution of South Atlantic CW. In the lower CW (below σ26.8), where minimal oxygen content is found, the tropical pathway is instead drasti- cally weakened in favor of a subtropical pathway. More than two thirds of the total water supply to this lower layer takes place north of 10°N, mainly via an eastward flow at 14°N and northern recirculations from the northern subtropical gyre. The existence of these northern jets explains the greater contribution of North Atlantic CW observed in the lower CW, making up to 50\{%\} of the water mass at the naOMZ core. The equatorward transfer of mass from the well-ventilated northern subtropical gyre emerges as an essential part of the ventilation of the naOMZ.},

   abstract = {We perform eddy-resolving and high vertical resolution numerical simulations of the circulation in an idealized equatorial Atlantic Ocean in order to explore the formation of the deep equatorial circulation (DEC) in this basin. Unlike in previous studies, the deep equatorial intraseasonal variability (DEIV) that is believed to be the source of the DEC is generated internally by instabilities of the upper-ocean currents. Two main simulations are discussed: solution 1, configured with a rectangular basin and with wind forcing that is zonally and temporally uniform, and solution 2, with realistic coastlines and an annual cycle of wind forcing varying zonally. Somewhat surprisingly, solution 1 produces the more realistic DEC; the large, vertical-scale currents [equatorial intermediate currents (EICs)] are found over a large zonal portion of the basin, and the small, vertical-scale equatorial currents [equatorial deep jets (EDJs)] form low-frequency, quasi-resonant, baroclinic equatorial basin modes with phase propagating mostly downward, consistent with observations. This study demonstrates that both types of currents arise from the rectification of DEIV, consistent with previous theories. The authors also find that the EDJs contribute to maintaining the EICs, suggesting that the nonlinear energy transfer is more complex than previously thought. In solution 2, the DEC is unrealistically weak and less spatially coherent than in the first simulation probably because of its weaker DEIV. Using intermediate solutions, this study finds that the main reason for this weaker DEIV is the use of realistic coastlines in solution 2. It remains to be determined what needs to be modified or included to obtain a realistic DEC in the more realistic configuration.},

   abstract = {A complex pattern of zonal currents below the thermocline has been observed in the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The currents have typical speeds from 10 to 15 cm s−1 and extend as deep as 2500 m. Their structure can be divided into two overlapping parts: the equatorial deep jets (EDJs), centered on the equator and alternating in the vertical with a wavelength of several hundred meters, and the Equatorial Intermediate Current system (EICS), composed of currents with large vertical scale and alternating with latitude over several degrees on either side of the equator. The strongest EICS current is a westward flow on the equator flanked by eastward currents at 2°N and 2°S. In the present study, the authors use idealized numerical simulations and analytical solutions to demonstrate that the EICS currents within 2.5° from the equator could result from the self-advection with dissipation of a downward-propagating beam of monthly periodic Yanai (Rossby gravity) waves. The zonally restricted beam is generated in the eastern part of the basin by instabilities of the swift near-surface equatorial currents. For a weak Yanai wave amplitude and no dissipation, mean Eulerian currents resembling the three strongest EICS currents are obtained but only within the beam; in this case, the Eulerian flow is balanced by the wave-induced Stokes drift, yielding a zero-mean Lagrangian flow, and the water parcels conserve their potential vorticity (PV) and are stationary over a wave cycle. For larger amplitudes, the Yanai waves break, losing their energy to small vertical scales where it is dissipated. This dissipation changes the mean (wave averaged) PV of a water parcel within the beam, allowing the parcel to have a persistent equatorward drift across PV contours. This can be viewed as a wave-induced Sverdrup transport; by continuity and by virtue of the westward group velocity of long Rossby waves, this Lagrangian-mean meridional flow requires a Lagrangian-mean zonal flow within and to the west of the beam, with a meridional structure consistent with the three strongest EICS currents. This mechanism of EICS formation is active in some ocean general circulation models; its importance in the ocean remains to be evaluated.},

The model consists of a finite but arbitarily large number of inviscid, homogeneous fluid layers each with a different density. The dynamical balances everywhere are Sverdrupian. IN regions where the Ekman pumping is negative (downward) the surface density is specified, i.e., the position of the outcrop of density interfaces is specified. This outcropping of density layers allows deep motion to be excited by the ventilation provided by Ekman pumping even in latitudes far south of the outcrop where the layer is shielded from direct influence of the wind. Analytical solutions are presented in the case where the density-outcrop lines are coincident with latitude circles. The solutions are not self-similar and important sub-domains of the solution are defined by critical potential vorticity trajectories which separate the ventilated from the unventilated regions in the lower thermocline. These critical trajectories also separate regions of strong variations in potential vorticity from regions of fairly weak variation in potential vorticity although the small variations in potential vorticity in the latter are crucial to the dynamics.},

This paper discusses the Connection Machine implementation of the model and its performance, as well as major changes that were made in the algorithms and numerical methods. In order to increase the parallel efficiency, we reformulated the barotropic equations to solve for the surface-pressure field rather than the volume-transport streamfunction. In addition to being more efficient, this method has several other advantages over the streamfunction formulation: (1) any number of islands can be included in the computational grid at no extra cost; (2) the model can handle steep gradients in the bottom topography; and (3) the free-surface height is a prognostic variable, which simplifies assimilation of altimetric data into the model. We have also developed a new parallelizable preconditioning method for the solution of the elliptic equation for the surface-pressure field. In order to use a standard conjugate gradient algorithm, an approximate-factorization technique is used to split off the Coriolis terms and obtain a symmetric operator. We then apply a symmetric local approximate-inverse operator as a preconditioning matrix, which is very effective in accelerating convergence to a solution. © 1992.},

   abstract = {The Tsuchiya jets (TJs) are narrow eastward currents, located a few degrees on either side of the equator at depths from 200 to 500 m in the Pacific Ocean. In this study, non-eddy-resolving, oceanic general circulation models (OGCMs) are used to investigate the dynamics of the southern TJ. Most solutions are found in a rectangular basin extending 100° zonally and from 40°S to 10°N. They are forced by idealized zonal and meridional winds representing the trades and the southerly winds near the South American coast, by a prescribed interocean circulation (IOC) that enters the basin through the southern boundary and exits through the western boundary from 2° to 6°N (the model's Indonesian passages), and by surface heating that warms the ocean in the Tropics. A suite of solutions is presented to isolate effects of each forcing and mixing process. A few solutions are also found to a global OGCM driven by realistic forcings. Solutions forced by all of the aforementioned processes and with minimal diffusion resemble the observed flow field in the tropical South Pacific. A narrow eastward current, the model southern TJ, flows across the basin along the southern edge of a thick equatorial thermostad, and upwells at the eastern boundary. Its deeper part is supplied by water that leaves the western boundary current somewhat south of the equator. Its shallower part originates from water that diverges from the deep portion of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC); as a result, the TJ transport increases to the east and the TJ warms as it flows across the basin. A major part of the water that upwells at the eastern boundary is supplied by the TJ with a minor contribution from the southern boundary region. In idealized-basin solutions without forcing either by the IOC or meridional wind, the TJ is weak or absent. These, and other, properties suggest that the dynamics of the model's TJ are those of an arrested front, which in a 21/2-layer model are generated when characteristics of the flow merge or intersect. When diffusivity is increased to commonly used values, the thermostad is less well defined or even absent and the TJ is weak, suggesting that excessive diffusion is the reason why TJs are not present in many previous OGCMs. In the solution to a global OGCM, the southern TJ still exists without the IOC, although it is warmed by 1°C, indicating that much of its water is supplied by an overturning cell confined within the Pacific basin. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

Analysis of a comprehensive oxygen dataset obtained from gliders, moorings, research vessels and Argo floats revealed that eddies with low oxygen concentrations at 50–150 m depths can be found in surprisingly high numbers and in a large area (from about 4°N to 22°N, from the shelf at the eastern boundary to 38°W). Minimum oxygen concentrations of about 9 µmol kg−1 in CEs and severely suboxic concentrations (−1) in ACMEs were observed. In total, 173 profiles with oxygen concentrations below the minimum background concentration of 40 µmol kg−1 could be associated with 27 independent “dead-zone” eddies (10 CEs; 17 ACMEs) over a period of 10 years. The eddies’ oxygen minimum is located in the eddy core beneath the mixed layer at a mean depth of 80 m. Compared to the surrounding waters, the mean oxygen anomaly between 50 and 150 m depth for CEs (ACMEs) is −38 (−79) µmol kg−1. The low oxygen concentration right beneath the mixed layer has been attributed to the combination of high productivity in the eddies’ surface waters and the isolation of their cores with respect to lateral oxygen supply. Indeed, eddies of both types feature a cold sea surface temperature anomaly and enhanced chlorophyll concentrations in their center. The locally increased consumption within these eddies represents an essential part of the total consumption in the open tropical Northeast Atlantic Ocean and might be partly responsible for the formation of the shallow oxygen minimum zone. Eddies south of 12°N carry weak hydrographic anomalies in their cores and seem to be generated in the open ocean away from the boundary. North of 12°N, eddies of both types carry anomalously low salinity water of South Atlantic Central Water origin from the eastern boundary upwelling region into the open ocean. Water mass properties and satellite eddy tracking both point to an eddy generation near the eastern boundary.},

This strong decrease seems to be related to changes in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Oscillations on shorter time scales (e.g., an El Niño signal in the upper 350 m) are superimposed upon this trend. In the section data, a general trend of decreasing oxygen is present below the surface layer. While velocity differences appear related to oxygen differences in the equatorial channel, there is less correlation elsewhere. Contrasting with long-term trend computations, the trends derived from two repeat sections are obscured by the influence of seasonal and longer-term variability. Multidecadal variability (e.g., PDO) has the strongest influence on long-term trends, while El Niño, isopycnal heave, current variability, seasonal cycles, and temperature changes are less important.},

   abstract = {Observations and model results both indicate increasing oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) in the tropical oceans. Here we report on record low dissolved oxygen minimum concentrations in the eastern tropical North Atlantic in fall of 2008, with less than 40 mu mol kg(-1) in the core of the OMZ. There we find a deoxygenation rate of similar to 0.5 mu mol kg(-1) a(-1) during the last decades on two repeat sections at 7.5 and 11 degrees N. The potential temperature and salinity in the surface and central water layers increased on both sections compared to previous observations. However, in contrast to the oxygen decrease in the core of the OMZ, increasing oxygen concentrations were observed in the central water layer above the OMZ. The observed deoxygenation was thus restricted to the core of the oxygen minimum layer. It remains unclear whether the vertical expansion of the oxygen minimum represents a long time trend or decadal variations. Citation: Stramma, L., M. Visbeck, P. Brandt, T. Tanhua, and D.

   abstract = {Abstract Interior circulation pathways from the subtropics to the equator are markedly different in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres of the Pacific Ocean. In the North Pacific the pycnocline shoals and strengthens dramatically under the intertropical convergence zone, separating the North Equatorial Current from the North Equatorial Countercurrent. While the high potential vorticity between these currents would intuitively seem to inhibit meridional water-property exchange between the subtopics and the equator, transient tracer analyses and some modeling studies have suggested an interior pathway from the subtropics to the equator in the pycnocline of the central North Pacific. This study delineates this pathway and estimates an upper bound for its magnitude at 5 (±1) × 109 kg s−1. In contrast, the southern branch of the South Equatorial Current clearly brings pycnocline water estimated at 15 (±1) × 109 kg s−1 from the southern subtropics directly to the equator in the South Pacific through an interior region of low and relatively uniform potential vorticity. In both hemispheres, these interior pathways extend downward as far as the lightest waters of the equatorial pycnostad. The subsurface countercurrents flanking the pycnostad form the equatorward limbs of tropical subsurface cyclonic gyres. These deep gyres are consistent with the absence of interior ventilation of the equator from the subtropics below the pycnocline. Measured and derived fields from a hydrographic climatology are presented on neutral surfaces and in meridional–vertical sections to show that salinity, potential vorticity, and acceleration potential are all consonant with these arguments. The vertical extent of interior communication is also in agreement with the transient tracer results.},

Averaged in stream coordinates, the core eastward velocity of the SCCs is a factor of 2 higher than previously reported means, but the estimated transports are unchanged. The meridional profile of zonal velocity along isopycnals is sharply peaked, and nearly linear on each flank of the current. The sharp and strong reversal of relative vorticity over a distance of 20 km at the jet core sharpens the coincident potential vorticity front. This front separates a region of very low homogeneous potential vorticity on the equatorward side from a homogeneous high potential vorticity region on the poleward side. Each potential vorticity pool extends well beyond the edges of the SCC into regions of westward flow. On the equatorward sides of the SCCs this westward flow is the Equatorial Intermediate Current in the western Pacific, but in the central and eastern parts of the basin it is off the equator in deep extensions of the South Equatorial Current. In the central and eastern regions the net westward transport in an isopycnal layer between the SCCs exceeds the combined eastward SCC transport in that layer. The net zonal transport between the SCC cores is highly divergent in the east and convergent in the west. This pattern, together with downstream changes in SCC density, indicates that neither they nor the westward return Rows are simple inertial recirculations; strong diapycnal processes must be involved.},

A distinct core with a diameter of about 70 km is found in the eddy, extending from about 60 to 200 m depth and. The core is occupied by fresh and cold water with low oxygen and high nitrate concentrations, and bordered by local maxima in buoyancy frequency. Velocity and property gradient sections show vertical layering at the flanks and underneath the eddy characteristic for vertical propagation (to several hundred-meters depth) of near inertial internal waves (NIW) and confirmed by direct current measurements. A narrow region exists at the outer edge of the eddy where NIW can propagate downward. NIW phase speed and mean flow are of similar magnitude and critical layer formation is expected to occur. An asymmetry in the NIW pattern is seen that possible relates to the large-scale Ekman transport interacting with ACME dynamics. NIW/mean flow induced mixing occurs close to the euphotic zone/mixed layer and upward nutrient flux is expected and supported by the observations. Combing high resolution nitrate (NO3&minus;) data with the apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) reveals AOU:NO3&minus; ratios of 16 which are much higher than in the surrounding waters (8.1). A maximum NO3&minus; deficit of 4 to 6 µmol kg&minus;1 is estimated for the low oxygen core. Denitrification would be a possible explanation. This study provides evidence that the recycling of NO3&minus;, extracted from the eddy core and replenished into the core via the particle export, may quantitatively be more important. In this case, the particulate phase is of keys importance in decoupling the nitrogen from the oxygen cycling.},

An index of equatorial Kelvin wave activity is defined based on Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA). Along the equator, results show a significant correlation between interannual PIRATA monthly dynamic height anomalies, altimetric monthly Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA), and SSHA calculated with an Ocean Linear Model. This allows us to interpret PIRATA records in terms of equatorial Kelvin waves. Estimated phase speed of eastward propagations from PIRATA equatorial mooring remains in agreement with the linear theory, emphasizing the dominance of the second baroclinic mode. Systematic analysis of all strong interannual equatorial SSHA shows that they precede by 1–2 months extreme interannual Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies along the African coast, which confirms the hypothesis that major warm and cold events in the Angola-Benguela current system are remotely forced by ocean atmosphere interactions in the equatorial Atlantic. Equatorial wave dynamics is at the origin of their developments. Wind anomalies in the Western Equatorial Atlantic force equatorial downwelling and upwelling Kelvin waves that propagate eastward along the equator and then poleward along the African coast triggering extreme warm and cold events, respectively. A proxy index based on linear ocean dynamics appears to be significantly more correlated with coastal variability than an index based on wind variability. Results show a seasonal phasing, with significantly higher correlations between our equatorial index and coastal SSTA in October–April season.},

   abstract = {Despite recent advances in ocean observing arrays and satellite sensors, there remains great uncertainty in the large-scale spatial variations of upper ocean salinity on the interannual to decadal time- scales. Consonant with both broad-scale surface warming and the amplification of the global hydrological cycle, observed global multidecadal salinity changes typically have focussed on the linear response to anthropogenic forcing but not on salinity variations due to changes in the static stability and or variability due to the intrinsic ocean or internal climate processes. Here, we examine the static stability and spatiotem- poral variability of upper ocean salinity across a hierarchy of models and reanalyses. In particular, we parti- tion the variance into time bands via application of singular spectral analysis, considering sea surface salinity (SSS), the Brunt V€ ais€ a frequency (N2), and the ocean salinity stratification in terms of the stabilizing al€ effect due to the haline part of N2 over the upper 500m. We identify regions of significant coherent SSS var- iability, either intrinsic to the ocean or in response to the interannually varying atmosphere. Based on con- sistency across models (CMIP5 and forced experiments) and reanalyses, we identify the stabilizing role of salinity in the tropics—typically associated with heavy precipitation and barrier layer formation, and the role of salinity in destabilizing upper ocean stratification in the subtropical regions where large-scale density compensation typically occurs.

The model successfully reproduces a large fraction ( < i > R < /i > 2ĝ€ Combining double low line ĝ€0.55) of the observed interannual variability in the equatorial Atlantic. In agreement with leading theories, our results confirm that the interannual variations of the dynamical forcing largely contributes to this variability.

   abstract = {The interannual variability of the Atlantic cold tongue (ACT) is studied by means of a mixed-layer heat budget analysis. A method to classify extreme cold and warm ACT events is proposed and applied to ten various analysis and reanalysis products. This classification allows 5 cold and 5 warm ACT events to be selected over the period 1982–2007. Cold (warm) ACT events are defined by the presence of negative (positive) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies at the center of the equatorial Atlantic in late boreal spring, preceded by negative (positive) zonal wind stress anomalies in the western equatorial Atlantic. An ocean general circulation model capable of reconstructing the interannual variability of the ACT correctly is used to demonstrate that cold ACT events develop rapidly from May to June mainly due to intense cooling by vertical mixing and horizontal advection. The simulated cooling at the center of the basin is the result of the combined effects of non-local and local processes. The non-local process is an upwelling associated with an eastward-propagating Kelvin wave, which makes the mixed-layer more shallow and preconditions the upper layers to be cooled by an intense heat loss at the base of the mixed-layer, which is amplified by a stronger local injection of energy from the atmosphere. The early cooling by vertical mixing in March is also shown to be a good predictor of June cooling. In July, horizontal advection starts to warm the mixed-layer abnormally and damps SST anomalies. The advection anomalies, which result from changes in the horizontal temperature gradient, are associated in some cases with the propagation of Rossby waves along the equator. During warm ACT events, processes are reversed, generating positive SST anomalies: a downwelling Kelvin wave triggers stratification anomalies and mixed-layer depth anomalies, amplified by a weaker injection of energy from the atmosphere in May–June. In July, warm ACT events are abnormally cooled due to negative horizontal advection anomalies resulting from processes similar to those that occur during cold ACT events. This additional cooling process extends the period of cooling of the ACT, reducing SST anomalies.},

Based on analyses of observational data, a deterministic mechanism relying on atmosphere&#8211;ocean&#8211;sea ice interactions is proposed for the AMO. Variations in the thermohaline circulation are reflected as uniform sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic. These anomalies are associated with a hemispheric wavenumber-1 sea level pressure (SLP) structure in the atmosphere that is amplified through atmosphere&#8211;ocean interactions in the North Pacific. The SLP pattern and its associated wind field affect the sea ice export through Fram Strait, the freshwater balance in the northern North Atlantic, and consequently the strength of the large-scale ocean circulation. It generates sea surface temperature anomalies with opposite signs in the North Atlantic and completes a negative feedback. The authors find that the time scale of the cycle is associated with the thermohaline circulation adjustment to freshwater forcing, the SST response to it, the oceanic adjustment in the North Pacific, and the sea ice response to the wind forcing. Finally, it is argued that the Great Salinity Anomaly in the late 1960s and 1970s is part of AMO.},

   abstract = {This paper reviews the observational and theoretical basis for the prediction of seasonal-to-interannual (S/I) climate variability in the Atlantic sector. The emphasis is on the large-scale picture rather than on regional details. The paper is divided into two main parts: a discussion of the predictability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)—the dominant pattern of variability in the North Atlantic—and a review of the tropical Atlantic prediction problem. The remote effects of El Niño are also mentioned as an important factor in Atlantic climate variability. Only a brief discussion is provided on the subject of South Atlantic climate predictability. Because of its chaotic dynamical nature, the NAO and its related rainfall and temperature variability, while highly significant over Europe and North America, are largely unpredictable. This also affects the predictive skill over the tropical Atlantic, because the NAO interferes with the remote influence of El Niño. That said, there appears to be an insufficiently understood, marginal signal in the NAO behavior that may be predictable and thus useful to certain end users. It is manifested in the deviation of the NAO temporal behavior from first-order autoregressive behavior. Tropical Atlantic climate variability centers on the sensitivity of the marine ITCZ to remote forcing from the equatorial Pacific and interactions with underlying sea surface temperature (SST) variability. Both mechanisms are potentially predictable—that is, given the underlying SSTs and the strength of El Niño, one could determine with a high degree of skill the anomalies in ITCZ position and intensity. However, local SSTs are easily affected by largely unpredictable North and South Atlantic phenomena, such as the NAO. In addition, the local ocean–atmosphere coupling in the Atlantic acts on relatively short time scales. Thus, in reality the level of skill indicated by forced model simulations are difficult to achieve. The use of coupled models may improve the prospects of tropical Atlantic prediction.},

Changes in the associated water mass formation might impact the deep ocean's capacity to take up anthropogenic CO2while a warming of the deep ocean significantly contributes to global sea level rise. Here we compile historic and recent shipboard measurements of hydrography and velocity to provide a comprehensive view of water mass distribution, pathways, along-path transformation and long-term temperature changes of NADW and AABW in the western South and Equatorial Atlantic. We confirm previous results which show that the northwest corner of the Brazil Basin represents a splitting point for the southward/northward flow of NADW/AABW. The available measurements sample water mass transformation along the two major routes for deep and bottom waters in the tropical to South Atlantic – along the deep western boundary and eastward, parallel to the equator - as well as the hot-spots of extensive mixing. We find lower NADW and lighter AABW to form a highly interactive transition layer in the northern Brazil Basin. The AABW north of 5°S is relatively homogeneous with only lighter AABW being able to pass through the Equatorial Channel (EQCH) into the North Atlantic. Spanning a period of 26 years, our data also allow an estimation of long-term temperature trends in abyssal waters. We find a warming of 2.5±0.7∙10−3 °C yr−1of the waters in the northern Brazil Basin at temperatures colder than 0.6 °C throughout the period 1989–2014 and can relate this warming to a thinning of the dense AABW layer. Whereas isopycnal heave is the dominant effect which defines the vertical distribution of temperature trends on isobars, we also find temperature changes on isopycnals in the lower NADW and AABW layers. There temperatures on isopycnals exhibit decadal variations with warming in the 1990s and cooling in the 2000s - the contributions to the trends on isobars range from about 50% in the lighter AABW layers in the EQCH up to a maximum of 80% in the transition layer the lower NADW and lighter AABW form in the northern Brazil Basin.},

In the near-surface\nlayer, above sigma. = 24.5, the inflow into the boundary regime came\ndominantly from low latitudes; out of the 14 Sv that crossed the\nequator in the upper part of the North Brazil Current (NBC), only\n2 Sv originated from south of 5 degrees S, while 12 Sv came in from\nthe east at 1 degrees-5 degrees S with the South Equatorial Current\n(SEC). After crossing the equator near 44 degrees W, only a minor\nfraction of the near-surface NBC retroflected eastward, while a net\nthrough flow of about 12 Sv above sigma. = 24.5 continued northwestward\nalong the boundary, By contrast, in the isopycnal range sigma. =\n24.5-26.8 encompassing the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), the source\nwaters of the equatorial circulation were dominantly of higher-latitude\nSouth Atlantic origin. While only 3 Sv of eastern equatorial water\nentered the region through the SEC at 3 degrees-5 degrees S, there\nwas an inflow of 10 Sv of South Atlantic water in the North Brazil\nUndercurrent (NBUC) along the South American coast that originated\nsouth of 10 degrees S, The transport of 14 Sv arriving at the equator\nalong the boundary in the undercurrent layer was almost entirely\nretroflected into the EUC with only marginal northern water additions\nalong its path to 35 degrees W. The off-equatorial undercurrents\nin the upper thermocline, the South and North Equatorial Undercurrents\ncarried only small transports across 35 degrees W, of 5 Sv and 3\nSv, respectively, dominantly supplied out of SEC recirculation rather\nthan out of the boundary current. Still deeper, three zonal undercurrents\nwere observed: the westward-flowing Equatorial Intermediate Current\n(EIC) in the depth range 200-900 m below the EUC, and two off-equatorial\neastward undercurrents, the Northern and Southern Intermediate Countercurrents\n(NICC, SICC) at 400-1000 m and 1 degrees-3 degrees latitude. In the\nlower part of the NBUC there was an Antarctic Intermediate Water\n(AAIW) inflow along the coast of 6 Sv, and there was a clear connection\nat the AAIW level to the SICC by low salinities and high oxygens\nand a weaker suggestion also that some supply of the NICC might be\nthrough AAIW out of the deep NBUC.},

   abstract = {Hydrographic trends in the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) layer that may be associated with changes in the thickness and oxygen content of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the eastern tropical South Atlantic (ETSA) and eastern tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) are investigated by using historical data (1960 to 2015). Our results reveal that the thickness of these OMZs has continually increased (2.58 ± 0.67 m yr−1for the ETSA and 3.37 ± 0.73 m yr−1for the ETNA), the mean oxygen concentration has decreased (– 0.12 ± 0.03 μmol kg−1 yr−1for the ETSA and − 0.17 ± 0.05 μmol kg−1 yr−1for the ETNA), and the mean temperature has increased. The optimum multiparameter analysis method is used to track modifications in the AAIW along its path through the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. We observe an AAIW layer vertical expansion rate of 1.67 ± 0.71 m yr−1, a decrease in the mean oxygen concentration of − 0.18 ± 0.04 μmol kg−1 yr−1and an increase in the mean temperature of 0.010 ± 0.005 °C yr−1. Moreover, a similar decrease in oxygen concentrations is observed in the AAIW layer of the studied OMZ regions compared to those in the non-AAIW portions of these OMZs, which indicates strong deoxygenation in this water mass over time. Our results suggest that warming in the AAIW source region and in its extensive temporal displacement through the SASG to the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean appreciably shifted this water mass toward lower densities with depleted oxygen (increases in ventilation age and oxygen consumption). The warming trend that is reported here suggests that global warming is one of the factors that influence oxygen solubility changes during the deoxygenation and expansion of OMZs.},

   abstract = {The simple Held and Hou (1980) nearly inviscid model of the axisymmetric atmospheric circulation, rationalizing the existence of Hadley cells, Jet Streams, and tropical homogenization of potential temperature and vorticity, is adapted to the oceanic subthermocline region. The meridional profile of radiative equilibrium temperature, which provides the driving in the atmospheric case, is replaced, in the oceanic case, by the large-scale equatorial doming of the thermocline. The meridional structure of the equatorial thermostad and the existence, at its poleward flanks, of eastward subsurface countercurrents coincident with sharp potential vorticity gradients are thus explained via angular momentum redistribution by secondary ageostrophic over-turning cells in the meridional plane. Taking into account the existence of the equatorial undercurrent within the thermocline has little effect on the overall structure of the subthermocline solution at a given longitude, even though homogenization of properties is less efficient.},

Mean meridional sections of potential temperature, salinity, neutral density anomaly, and the square of buoyancy frequency are presented for the western. central, and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. These sections are used together with maps of depth and salinity on isopycnals, as well as thickness between isopycnals, to describe the evolution of the Tsuchiya jets as they flow from west to east. An inertial-jet model is formulated in which conservation of the Bernoulli function and potential vorticity combine with the eastward shoaling of the tropical pycnocline to dictate the jet structure. This model jet is consistent with a number of features of the Tsuchiya jets: their roughly constant volume transports. their advection of properties such as salinity and oxygen over long zonal distances. their rapidity and narrowness, their poleward shift from west to east, the large potential vorticity gradients across them, and the pycnostad between them that builds in size and strength from west to east. However. an observed decrease in density carried by the Tsuchiya jets from west to east, not included in the model jet, suggests that diffusive or advective interaction with the surrounding ocean also may be important in subsurface countercurrent dynamics.},

   abstract = {Several shipboard sections acquired in the western equatorial Atlantic along 35°W allow for the first time to analyze the annual cycle of the density and velocity field in the upper 2000 m within this region. The amplitude of the annual harmonic of the velocity field shows several distinct maxima at the equator. Strong amplitudes up to 15cms-1 are found in the depth range of the equatorial intermediate current (EIC) between 400 and 1000 m depth that are slightly shifted northward with respect to the equator. The meridional structure of the annual harmonics as well as upward phase propagation is consistent with downward propagating odd meridional mode Rossby waves. The observations are compared with a regional numerical model with very high vertical resolution. Good agreement is found between the simulated and observed structure and the amplitude of the annual harmonics. The model results suggest the presence of equatorial beams composed of wind-generated Kelvin and Rossby beams (causing seasonality in the near surface layer) as well as Rossby beams generated by the reflection of Kelvin beams at the eastern boundary (causing seasonality in the depth range of the EIC at the 35°W section). The annual cycle of the sea surface height (SSH) observed by TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry indicates an east-west seesaw pattern that corresponds to the fast response (about 30 days lag) of the zonal SSH gradient to the annual cycle of the zonal wind field at the equator due to the propagation of lowest baroclinic mode equatorial waves. The increase of the easterly winds in the western equatorial Atlantic associated with El Nino in the beginning of 1997 led almost instantaneously to an adjustment of the zonal SSH gradient with elevated (depressed) SSH in the western (eastern) basin. In contrast, the velocity field at intermediate depths lags the zonal wind forcing by several months up to a year as the model simulation reveals. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {A suite of high-resolution models of the Atlantic Ocean circulation is used to study the deep seasonal current variability in the equatorial regime, with a particular emphasis on its manifestation in the variability of the interhemispheric transports near the western boundary. The basic experiment has a resolution of 1/3°horizontally and 45 vertical levels, and is subject to a monthly mean atmospheric forcing based on ECMWF flux fields. Sensitivity experiments explore the effects of higher horizontal resolution (1/12°), and alternative mixing parameterizations. The model behavior near the equator confirms previous suggestions based on solutions of the WOCE Community Modelling Effort ("CME") and the "DYNAMO" model intercomparison project, of the presence of a system of vigorous seasonal current oscillations, spanning the whole water column and nearly the whole zonal extent of the basin. The patterns of the primarily zonal current anomalies are fairly robust across the range of model cases investigated, i.e., show relatively little sensitivity to horizontal resolution/mixing, or to the different choices of vertical discretization and vertical mixing as in the DYNAMO cases. The amplitude of the seasonal variation exceeds 10 cm/s in the surface layer, and decreases to about 5 cm/s near 1000 m and 2-3 cm/s in the deep ocean in both the basic 1/3°- and the 1/12°-cases, thereby leading to seasonally reversing current signatures at all depths below the EUC. A particular aspect of the seasonal current variability concerns its manifestation in the southward transport of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) by the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC). The temporal characteristics of the DWBC variability are in agreement with moored current meter observations at 44°W, with simulated DWBC transports varying between a maximum of more than 30 Sv in January/February, and almost vanishing transport in September. However, in contrast to the annual-mean deep water transport which is confined to the DWBC and tight, O(100) km-recirculation cells, the seasonal cycle of transport is not trapped near the boundary: the simulations show that the zonal current variations of the equatorial wave guide, near the western boundary give rise to a broad system of seasonal recirculation cells of the DWBC. Calculations of the amplitude of the seasonal variability in the deep water transport near the equator are therefore strongly dependent of the spatial extent of the cross-section considered; in particular, for being approximately representative of low-frequency variations in the net, zonally-integrated meridional transport of deep water in the equatorial regime, transport sections would need to extend over nearly the whole western basin. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The inclusion of these decadal oxygen trends in the recently estimated oxygen budget for the ETNA OMZ showed a weakened ventilation of the upper 400&amp;thinsp;m, whereas the ventilation strengthened homogeneously over depth below 400&amp;thinsp;m.

Shipboard, float and satellite observations of velocity and hydrography indicate different regional as well as remote changes in the circulation pattern to be responsible for the change in the ventilation of the ETNA. The reduced ventilation in the upper 400&amp;thinsp;m may have been induced by a southward shift of the wind-driven circulation or by a change of the composition of South Atlantic Central Water. There are hints that below 400&amp;thinsp;m, latitudinally alternating zonal jets have strengthened, thus contributing to the increased ventilation. Nevertheless, temporal changes in isopycnal eddy supply or diapycnal supply (diapycnal mixing as well as diapycnal advection) cannot be excluded in having contributed to the observed oxygen change.</p>},

   abstract = {Diapycnal diffusivity estimates from two Tracer Release Experiments (TREs) and microstructure measurements in the oxycline and core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) are compared. For the first time, two TREs within the same area at different depths were realized: the Guinea Upwelling Tracer Release Experiment (GUTRE) initiated in 2008 in the oxycline at approximately 320 m depth, and the Oxygen Supply Tracer Release Experiment (OSTRE) initiated in 2012 in the core of the OMZ at approximately 410 m depth. The mean diapycnal diffusivity Dzwas found to be insignificantly smaller in the OMZ core with (1.06±0.24)×10-5m2s-1compared to (1.11±0.22)×10-5m2s-190 m shallower in the oxycline. Unexpectedly, GUTRE tracer was detected during two of the OSTRE surveys which showed that the estimated diapycnal diffusivity from GUTRE over a time period of seven years was within the uncertainty of the previous estimates over a time period of three years. The results are consistent with the Dzestimates from microstructure measurements and demonstrate that Dzdoes not vary significantly vertically in the OMZ within the depth range of 200-600 m and does not change with time. The presence of a seamount chain in the vicinity of the GUTRE injection region did not cause enhanced Dzcompared to the smoother bottom topography of the OSTRE injection region, although the analysis of vertical shear spectra from ship ADCP data showed elevated internal wave energy level in the seamount vicinity. However, the two tracer patches covered increasingly overlapping areas with time and thus spatially integrated increasingly similar fields of local diffusivity, as well as the difference in local stratification counteracted the influence of roughness on Dz. For both experiments no significant vertical displacements of the tracer were observed, thus diapycnal upwelling within the ETNA OMZ is below the uncertainty level of 5myr-1.},

The hypothesis tested was that central CRF affects USV rate biphasically: as endogenous CRF increases from low basal levels it initiates USV production, but at higher levels CRF diminishes USV production. As predicted, the largest doses of CRF (0.1 and 1 ??g) and of its antagonist alpha-helical CRF\n                        9-41 (aH-CRF; 20 ??g) administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) reduced USV rate compared to saline treatment during a 2-min isolation at ambient temperature in pups of all ages. Other behaviors were either unaffected or increased by drug treatment. Effects were not attributable to sedation or to a change in core temperature. Peripheral administration of 1 ??g CRF or 20 ??g aH-CRF had no effect. When isolation occurred in a heated chamber containing soiled bedding from the home cage to minimize baseline USV rate, ICV-CRF (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 ??g) did not enhance the rate. The quieting ability of aH-CRF is evidence that central endogenous CRF enhances the rate of ongoing USVs during brief isolation; the quieting ability of CRF suggests that this peptide may also be responsible for the reduction in USV rate that normally occurs during more protracted isolation. However, CRF alone is not sufficient to induce vocalizing in quiet pups.},

All available quality-controlled profiles of temperature (T) and salinity (S) versus pressure (P) collected by conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instruments from the Argo Program, Ice- Tethered Profilers, and archived in the World Ocean Database are used. MIMOC provides maps of mixed layer properties (conservative temperature, properties ( , Absolute Salinity, SA, and maximum P) as well as maps of interior ocean , SA, and P) to 1950 dbar on isopycnal surfaces. A third product merges the two onto a pressure grid spanning the upper 1950 dbar, adding more familiar potential temperature (θ) and practical salinity (S) maps. All maps are at monthly × 0.5° × 0.5° resolution, spanning from 80°S to 90°N. Objective mapping routines used and described here incorporate an isobath-following component using a “Fast Marching” algorithm, as well as front- sharpening components in both the mixed layer and on interior isopycnals. Recent data are emphasized in the mapping. The goal is to compute a climatology that looks as much as possible like synoptic surveys sampled circa 2007–2011 during all phases of the seasonal cycle, minimizing transient eddy and wave signatures. MIMOC preserves a surface mixed layer, minimizes both diapycnal and isopycnal smoothing of –S, as well as preserving density structure in the vertical (pycnoclines and pycnostads) and the horizontal (fronts and their associated currents). It is statically stable and resolves water-mass features, fronts, and currents with a high level of detail and fidelity.},

   abstract = {Ocean models predict a decline in the dissolved oxygen inventory of the global ocean of one to seven per cent by the year 2100, caused by a combination of a warming-induced decline in oxygen solubility and reduced ventilation of the deep ocean. It is thought that such a decline in the oceanic oxygen content could affect ocean nutrient cycles and the marine habitat, with potentially detrimental consequences for fisheries and coastal economies. Regional observational data indicate a continuous decrease in oceanic dissolved oxygen concentrations in most regions of the global ocean, with an increase reported in a few limited areas, varying by study. Prior work attempting to resolve variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations at the global scale reported a global oxygen loss of 550 ± 130 teramoles (1012 mol) per decade between 100 and 1,000 metres depth based on a comparison of data from the 1970s and 1990s10. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of the entire ocean oxygen inventory by analysing dissolved oxygen and supporting data for the complete oceanic water column over the past 50 years. We find that the global oceanic oxygen content of 227.4 ± 1.1 petamoles (1015 mol) has decreased by more than two per cent (4.8 ± 2.1 petamoles) since 1960, with large variations in oxygen loss in different ocean basins and at different depths. We suggest that changes in the upper water column are mostly due to a warming- induced decrease in solubility and biological consumption. Changes in the deeper ocean may have their origin in basin-scale multi- decadal variability, oceanic overturning slow-down and a potential increase in biological consumption.},

   abstract = {Climate change and its impact on our life, our en- vironment and ecosystems in general, are in these days at the forefront of public concern and polit- ical attention. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports have amply doc- umented that anthropogenic climate change is an ongoing trend, which will continue into the future and may be associated with grave implications. Thus, one conclusion to be drawn is clear – the driver for this climate change should be curtailed to the extent socially responsible and sustainable. We need to strongly reduce the emissions of radia- tively active gases into the atmosphere. However, even the most optimistic emission re- duction scenarios envision only a limited success in thwarting climate change. What is possible is to limit this change, but it can no longer be avoided altogether. Even if the challenging goal of a sta- bilization of global mean temperature at an upper limit of 2˚C above pre-industrial levels at the end of this century will be met, significant pressures on societies and ecosystems for adaptation will be the result. Thus, adaptation to recent, ongoing and possible future climate change is unavoidable. The BACC initiative has dealt with these pres- sures for the region of the Baltic Sea Basin, which includes the Baltic Sea and its entire water catch- ment, covering almost 20% of the European conti- nent. BACC has collected, reviewed and summa- rized the existing knowledge about recent, ongoing and possible futures regional climate change and its impact on marine and terrestrial ecosystems in this region. The acronym BACC stands for BALTEX Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin and denotes an initiative within BALTEX (Baltic Sea Experiment), which is a Regional Hydrometeorology Project within the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) of the World Climate Research Pro- gram (WCRP). The first chapter of the book places the initia- tive in context, clarifies a few key concepts and summarizes the key results; Chapters 2 to 5 doc- ument the knowledge about recent and ongoing changes in meteorological, oceanographical, hy- drological and cryospherical variables, about sce- narios of possible future climatic conditions, about changes in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, and about changes in marine ecosystems. A series of appendices provide background material rele- vant in this context. Two remarkable aspects of the BACC initia- tive should be mentioned. The first is the accep- tance of this report by the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) as a basis for its intergovernmental management of the Baltic Sea environment. Based on this BACC report, HELCOM has compiled its own conclusions “Climate Change in the Baltic Sea Area – HELCOM Thematic Assessment in 2007”. The second aspect is the fact that the BACC re- port was made possible by the voluntary effort of many individuals and institutions – without ded- icated payment from scientific agencies, govern- ments, NGOs, industries or other possibly vested interests. We think this adds significantly to the credibility of this effort, which we expect will be used as a blueprint for assessments of other regions in the world. The success of BACC has convinced BALTEX that it would be worth to redo the effort in about five years time – assuming that significantly more knowledge has been generated, and that climate change has emerged even more clearly from the “sea of noise” of natural climate variability},

   abstract = {We present a suite of experiments with a hierarchy of biogeochemical models of increasing complexity coupled to an offline global ocean circulation model based on the " transport matrix method" Biogeochemical model structures range from simple nutrient models to more complex nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus-DOP models. The models' skill is assessed by various misfit functions with respect to observed phosphate and oxygen distributions. While there is generally good agreement between the different metrics employed, an exception is a cost function based on the relative model-data misfit. We show that alterations in parameters and/or structure of the models - especially those that change particle export or remineralization profile - affect subsurface and mesopelagic phosphate and oxygen, particularly in the upwelling regions. Visual inspection of simulated biogeochemical tracer distributions as well as the evaluation of different cost functions suggest that increasing complexity of untuned, unoptimized models, simulated with parameters commonly used in large-scale model studies does not necessarily improve performance. Instead, variations in individual model parameters may be of equal, if not greater, importance. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The model is based on nitrate as the sole limiting nutrient. Prognostic equations for nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus are solved online in the three-dimensional ocean circulation model component. Experiments with different parameterizations of vertical mixing, including a scheme of tidally driven mixing, changes in buoyancy forcing in the Southern Ocean, different particle sinking velocities, and the inclusion of dissolved organic matter are performed, and the results are compared with observations. The results reemphasize the roles of Southern Ocean freshwater forcing and diapycnal mixing in the low-latitude pycnocline in setting the global deep water circulation and properties. The influence of high mixing in the Southern Ocean as inferred from observations is much more limited. The deep water circulation also has a strong influence on the marine ecosystem and nutrient distributions. We demonstrate that larger values of vertical diffusion lead to a shallower nutricline due to increased upwelling. Export production and nutrient distributions respond sensitively to changes in mixing and to the ratio of particle sinking to remineralization in the upper ocean. The best fits to global measurements of temperature, salinity, deep ocean radiocarbon, mixed layer depth, nutrients, and chlorophyll are obtained for values of vertical mixing in the pycnocline of around 0.2–0.3 × 10−4 m2/s and for e-folding depth for particle remineralization of 100–200 m. A simple parameterization of dissolved organic matter dynamics increases primary production and nutrient concentrations in the upper ocean and improves chlorophyll distributions in the subtropical gyres but has no discernible influence on particulate export fluxes. Remaining model deficiencies are identified, and strategies for future model improvement are outlined.},

Three surveys, performed 7, 20, and 30 months after the release, sampled the vertically and laterally expanding tracer patch.

The latter method is preferable in the regions of different stratification for it yields local diapycnal mixing estimates varying less with stratification than their Cartesian coordinate counterparts. Results of this study are comparable to the results of the North Atlantic tracer release experiment (NATRE). However, the internal wave-wave interaction models predict reduced mixing from the breaking of internal waves at low latitudes. Thus, the diapycnal diffusivity found in this study is higher than parameterized by the low latitude of the site (4°N&#8211;12°N).},

Noting that a key uncertainty for future convection resides in the relative importance of melting in summer and atmospheric forcing in winter, we investigate the extent to which summer conditions constrain convection with a comprehensive dataset, including hydrographic records that are over a decade in length from the convection regions. We find that warm and fresh summers, characterized by increased sea surface temperatures, freshwater concentrations and melting, are accompanied by reduced heat and buoyancy losses in winter, which entail a longer persistence of the freshwater near the surface and contribute to delaying convection. By shortening the time span for the convective freshwater export, the identified seasonal dynamics introduce a potentially critical threshold that is crossed when substantial amounts of freshwater from one summer are carried over into the next and accumulate. Warm and fresh summers in the Irminger Sea are followed by particularly short convection periods. We estimate that in the winter 2010–2011, after the warmest and freshest Irminger Sea summer on our record, ~40% of the surface freshwater was retained.},

   abstract = {Using idealized and realistic high-resolution primitive equation models, we explore the annual and semi-annual period fluctuations in the deep equatorial Atlantic Ocean. The deep seasonal variability derives its energy from the equatorial zonal wind stress component and the wind energy reaches the deep layers by means of vertically propagating Kelvin and Rossby waves. The first meridional mode (l=1) annual Rossby wave reaches the western boundary while the other Rossby waves directly propagate toward the bottom. A deep Kelvin wave is generated by the reflection of the incoming l=1 annual Rossby wave at the western boundary. Due to the complexity of the surface layers in the non-linear simulations, one cannot separate the waves generated at the boundaries and the waves directly forced by the wind. Below the thermocline, the waves characteristics agree well with the linear theory when considering the Kelvin and the l=1 Rossby wave but discrepancies occur for the l=3 and 5 Rossby waves. Non-linearities explain that minima reached by the zonal velocity anomaly is larger, in absolute value, than maxima. An important result of that study concerns the enhancement of the semi-annual cycle compared to the annual signal in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. A resonance phenomenon occurs even when realistic coastline geometry, dissipation and non-linear terms are taken into account. Along with the wind-stress amplitude, the forcing period and the basin width, the horizontal dissipation controls the amplitude of the deep seasonal fluctuations. The waves are damped during their propagation when the lateral dissipation coefficient is set to a high value (νh=2000 m2s-1). In an "inviscid" regime (when the waves reach the other side of the basin before being damped), the amplitude of the deep reponse is not much influenced by the parameterization chosen. Finally, bottom reflections are not necessary for the set up of the deep response and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge does not change the nature of the deep signal. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here we provide evidence for a weakening of the AMOC by about 3 ± 1 sverdrups (around 15 per cent) since the mid-twentieth century. This weakening is revealed by a characteristic spatial and seasonal sea-surface temperature ‘fingerprint’—consisting of a pattern of cooling in the subpolar Atlantic Ocean and warming in the Gulf Stream region—and is calibrated through an ensemble of model simulations from the CMIP5 project. We find this fingerprint both in a high-resolution climate model in response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and in the temperature trends observed since the late nineteenth century. The pattern can be explained by a slowdown in the AMOC and reduced northward heat transport, as well as an associated northward shift of the Gulf Stream. Comparisons with recent direct measurements from the RAPID project and several other studies provide a consistent depiction of record-low AMOC values in recent years.},

In this paper, we study quasi-stationary striations, which are best seen in the multi-year time-averaged velocity fields. Using 1993–2002 mean dynamic ocean topography, satellite altimeter observations, and output of the Ocean General Circulation Model for the Earth Simulator, the dynamics of the quasi-stationary striations in the eastern parts of the subtropical North and South Pacific are examined by assessing individual terms in the time-averaged equations of relative and potential vorticity. While non-linear effects are found to be essential in the dynamics of the striations, rejecting some linear hypotheses forwarded in the earlier studies, the relevance of the Rhines mechanism is not confirmed. Eddy flux does not act as a relative vorticity source for the striations. Using the potential vorticity (PV) diagnostics, we show that the time-mean PV is not conserved along the time-mean streamlines, and on the scale of the striations these changes in PV are largely induced by the eddy flux of layer thickness. The fact that eddy fluxes contribute to the striations’ time-mean PV budget suggests that the striations are not a kinematical artifact of time-averaging of westward-propagating eddies.},

In particular, the authors focus on the role of eddy flux convergences (“eddy forcing”) in supporting the buoyancy and relative/potential vorticity (PV) anomalies associated with the jets. The results suggest a central role of baroclinic eddies in the barotropic and baroclinic dynamics of the jets, and significant differences in the effects of eddy forcing between the subtropical and subpolar gyres.

   abstract = {The large-scale impacts of sub-mesoscale physics are addressed by comparing mean characteristics of basin-scale, seasonally varying, subtropical and subpolar gyres in a suite of numerical experiments varying in horizontal resolution (1°, 1/9° and 1/54°) and accordingly, in sub-grid scale mixing. After 100. years of simulation, and as suggested from earlier studies, the mean circulation and the mean structure of the ventilated thermocline strongly differ when switching from 1° to 1/9° resolution. Our results emphasize that increasing the resolution from 1/9° to 1/54° leads to major further changes. These changes ensue from the emergence of a denser and more energetic vortex population at 1/54°, occupying most of the basin and sustained by sub-mesoscale physics. Non-linear effects of this turbulence strongly intensify the jet that separates the two gyres, thus steepening the isopycnals and counter-balancing the strong eddy-driven heat transport that tends to flatten them. The jet is more zonal, penetrates further to the east, and is shifted southward by a few degrees, which significantly alters the shape and position of the gyres. The strengthening of the main jet comes together with the emergence of a regime of energetic secondary zonal jets, associated with complex recirculations. In parallel, sub-mesoscales restratify both the seasonal and the main thermocline, inducing in particular a reduction of deep convection and the modification of the water masses involved in the meridional overturing circulation. Although the results presented here are presumably highly constrained by the idealized geometry of our basin, they suggest that sub-mesoscale processes play an important role on the mean circulation and mean transports at the scale of oceanic basins. At the highest resolution presented here (1/54°), momentum effects are becoming important so that eddies do not simply cause the slumping of isopycnals but can arrange the flow to form jet-like structures with steeper isopycnals in places. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

On a recent parameterization of mesoscale eddies. J. Phys. Oceanogr. 26 (3), 406-416] suggested that this dissipation could ultimately involve irreversible mixing of buoyancy by molecular processes at the small-scale end of the turbulence cascade. We revisit this idea and argue that the presence of dissipation within the thermocline automatically requires that a component of the eddy flux associated with meso-scale eddies must be associated with irreversible mixing of buoyancy within the thermocline. We offer a parameterisation of the implied diapycnal diffusivity based on (i) the dissipation rate for eddy kinetic energy given by the meso-scale eddy closure of Eden and Greatbatch [Eden, C., Greatbatch, R.J., 2008. Towards a meso-scale eddy closure. Ocean Modell. 20, 223-239.] and (ii) a fixed mixing efficiency. The implied eddy-induced diapycnal diffusivity (κ) is implemented in a coarse resolution model of the North Atlantic. In contrast to the vertical diffusivity given by a standard vertical mixing scheme, large lateral inhomogeneities can be found for κ in the interior of the ocean.

Climate change projection till the end of this century predict a 4 to 7% decline in the dissolve oxygen in the ocean [Bopp et al., 2002; Matear et al., 2000; Plattner et al., 2001; Sarmiento et al., 1998] suggesting the potential for global warming to eventually drive the deep ocean anoxic. To examine the multicentury impact of protracted global warming on oceanic concentrations of dissolved oxygen, we use a climate system model and a low-order oceanic biogeochemical model. The models are integrated for an atmospheric equivalent CO2 concentration, which is specified to triple according to a standard scenario from the late nineteenth to the late twenty-first century, and then is subsequently held constant at that elevated level for an additional 6 centuries. For the present day, the model successfully reproduced the large-scale features of the dissolved oxygen field in the ocean. In the global warming simulation, the physical model displays marked changes in high-latitude oceanic stratification and overturning, including near-cessation of deep water renewal for depths greater than about 1.5 km during the period of elevated stable CO2 concentration. Our model predicts a decline in oxygen concentration through most of the subsurface ocean. Concentration changes in the thermocline waters result mainly from solubility changes in the upstream source waters, while changes in the deep waters result mainly from lack of ventilation and ongoing consumption of oxygen by remineralization of sinking particulate organic matter. Changes in the upper 2 km of the ocean generally show signs of equilibration by the end of the integration, but at greater depths, there occurs a slow but steady decline through to the end of the integration. By the end of the integration, we simulate a doubling of the volume of hypoxic water (less than 10 μmol/kg) in the thermocline of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. During the integration deep ocean oxygen concentrations generally decline by between 20 and 40%, but, significantly, no extensive deep ocean anoxia develops during the period of integration, nor does it appear that it would likely do so for at least a further 4000 years of integration. Subsurface oxygen decline is moderated by an overall reduction in export production of particulate organic matter, which reduces oxygen consumption in the ocean interior due to the remineralization of this material.},

   abstract = {A chronic difficulty in obtaining reliable climate records from satellites has been changes in instruments, platforms, equator-crossing times, and algorithms. The microwave sounding unit (MSU) tropospheric temperature record has overcome some of these problems, but evidence is presented that it too contains unreliable trends over a 17-yr period (1979-95) because of transitions involving different satellites and complications arising from nonatmospheric signals associated with the surface. The two primary MSU measures of tropospheric temperature contain different error characteristics and trends. The MSU channel 2 record exhibits a slight warming trend since 1979. Its broad vertical weighting function means that the temperature signal originates from throughout the troposphere and part of the lower stratosphere; intersatellite comparisons reveal low noise levels. Off-nadir channel 2 data are combined to provide an adjusted weighting function (called MSU 2R) without the stratospheric signal, but at a cost of an increased influence of surface emissions. Land surface microwave emissions, which account for about 20% of the total signal, depend on ground temperature and soil moisture and are subject to large variations associated with the diurnal cycle. The result is that MSU 2R noise levels are a factor of 3 larger than for MSU 2 and are sufficient to corrupt trends when several satellite records are merged. After allowing for physical differences between the satellite and surface records, large differences remain in temperature trends over the Tropics where there is a strong and deterministic coupling with the surface. The authors use linear regression with observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and an atmospheric general circulation model to relate the tropical MSU and surface datasets. These and alternative analyses of the MSU data, radiosonde data, and comparisons between the MSU 2R and channel 2 records, with estimates of their noise, are used to. show that the downward trend in tropical MSU 2R temperatures is very likely spurious. Tropical radiosonde records are of limited use in resolving the discrepancies because of artificial trends arising from changes in instruments or sensors; however, comparisons with Australian radiosondes show a spurious downward jump in MSU 2R in mid-1991, which is not evident in MSU 2. Evaluation of reanalyzed tropical temperatures from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts shows that they contain very different and false trends, as the analyses are only as good as the input database. Statistical analysis of the MSU 2R record objectively identifies two stepwise downward discontinuities that coincide with satellite transitions. The first is in mid-1981, prior to which only one satellite was in operation for much of the time so the diurnal cycle was not well sampled. Tropical SST anomalies over these years were small, in agreement with the Southern Oscillation index, yet the MSU 2R values were anomalously warm by similar to 0.25 degrees C. The second transition from NOAA-10 to NOAA-12 in mid-1991 did not involve an overlap except with NOAA-11, which suffered from a large drift in its equator-crossing times. MSU 2R anomalies have remained anomalously cold since mid-1991 by similar to 0.1 degrees C. Adding the two stepwise discontinuities to the tropical MSU 2R record allows it to be completely reconciled with the SST record within expected noise levels. The statistical results also make physical sense as the tropical satellite anomalies are magnified relative to SST anomalies by a factor of similar to 1.3, which is the amplification expected following the saturated adiabatic lapse rate to the level of the peak weighting function of MSU 2R.},

   abstract = {AbstractSeasonal variability of the tropical Atlantic circulation is dominated by the annual cycle, but semiannual variability is also pronounced, despite weak forcing at that period. This study uses multiyear, full-depth velocity measurements from the central equatorial Atlantic to analyze the vertical structure of annual and semiannual variations of zonal velocity. A baroclinic modal decomposition finds that the annual cycle is dominated by the fourth mode and the semiannual cycle is dominated by the second mode. Similar local behavior is found in a high-resolution general circulation model. This simulation reveals that the annual and semiannual cycles of the respective dominant baroclinic modes are associated with characteristic basinwide structures. Using an idealized, linear, reduced-gravity model to simulate the dynamics of individual baroclinic modes, it is shown that the observed circulation variability can be explained by resonant equatorial basin modes. Corollary simulations of the reduced-gravity model with varying basin geometry (i.e., square basin vs realistic coastlines) or forcing (i.e., spatially uniform vs spatially variable wind) show a structural robustness of the simulated basin modes. A main focus of this study is the seasonal variability of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) as identified in recent observational studies. Main characteristics of the observed EUC including seasonal variability of transport, core depth, and maximum core velocity can be explained by the linear superposition of the dominant equatorial basin modes as obtained from the reduced-gravity model.},

   abstract = {AimThe lives of juvenile leatherback turtles are amongst the most enigmatic of all marine mega-vertebrates. For these cryptic organisms, ocean models provide important insights into their dispersion from natal sites. Here, corroborated by fisheries bycatch data, we simulate spatio-temporal variation in hatchling dispersion patterns over five decades from the World's largest leatherback turtle nesting region. LocationEquatorial Central West Africa (3.5 degrees N to -6 degrees S) spanning the Gulf of Guinea in the North, Gabon and the Republic/Democratic Republic of the Congo in the South. ResultsDue to dynamic oceanic conditions at these equatorial latitudes, dispersion scenarios differed significantly: (1) along the north to south gradient of the study region, (2) seasonally and (3) between years. From rookeries to the north of the equator, simulated hatchling retention rates within the Gulf of Guinea were very high (>99%) after 6months of drift, whilst south of the equator, retention rates were as low as c.6% with the majority of simulated hatchlings dispersing west into the South Atlantic Ocean with the South Equatorial Current. Seasonal dispersion variability was driven by wind changes arising from the yearly north/southward migration of the intertropical convergence zone resulting in the increasing westerly dispersion of hatchlings throughout the hatching season. Annual variability in wind stress drove a long-term trend for decreased retention within the Gulf of Guinea and increased westerly dispersion into habitats in the South Atlantic Ocean. Main conclusionsShifts in dispersion habitats arising from spatio-temporal oceanic variability expose hatchlings to different environments and threats that will influence important life history attributes such as juvenile growth/survival rates; anticipated to impact the population dynamics and size/age structure of populations into adulthood. The impacts of local and dynamic oceanic conditions thus require careful considerations, such as subregional management, when managing marine populations of conservation concern.},

Inferences based on long-term sea sur- face temperature records, however, supported by model simulations, suggest a variability with an amplitude of 61.5–3 Sv (1Sv5106m3 s21) on decadal timescales in the subtropics6 . Such variability has been attributed to variations of deep water formation in the sub-arctic Atlantic, particularly the renewal rate of Labrador Sea Water7 .Herewepresent results fromamodel simulation that suggest an additional influence on decadal MOC variability having a Southern Hemisphere origin: dynamic signals originating in the Agulhas leakage region at the southern tip of Africa.

The simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the 20CR and the CORE simulations have comparable variability as well as mean strength during the last three decades of the integration. The simulated AMOC undergoes, however, distinctly different evolutions during the period 1948-1970, with a sharply declining strength in CORE but a gradual increase in 20CR. Sensitivity experiments suggest that differences in the wind forcing between CORE and 20CR have major impact on the simulated AMOCs during this period. It is furthermore found that differences in the air temperature between the two data sets do contribute to the differences in AMOC, but to a much lesser degree than the wind. An additional factor for the diverging AMOC in the two decades following 1948 is the inevitable switching of atmospheric forcing fields in 1948 in the CORE.v2-based runs due to the cyclic spin-up procedure of the ocean model. The latter is a fundamental issue for any ocean hindcast simulation. The ocean initial state mainly influence the actual value but to a lesser degree also the temporal evolution (variability) of AMOC. It may take about two decades for the AMOC to adjust to a new atmospheric state during the spin-up, although a dynamically balanced ocean initial state tends to reduce the adjustment time and the magnitude of the deviation, implying that an ocean model run with atmospheric forcing fields extending back in time, like 20CRv2, can be used to extend the reliable duration of CORE-type of simulations.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To describe the development of emotional distress among patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to explore for early predictors of elevated distress over time. Methods: The study group consisted of 158 early RA patients (64% females) with mean age of 51.4 (SD=12.7) years at disease onset. The patients were evaluated once a year for up to at least 4 years after baseline. Emotional distress was measured with the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90), disability with the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), pain with a visual analogue scale (VAS), and disease activity by an active joint count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Questions concerning social support were also included. Results: Emotional distress decreased slowly for a majority of the patients. The change reached statistical significance in the third year from study start. A minority (12%) showed continuously high and increasing levels of distress. Measures of disease activity were poor predictors of distress. The best predictor of distress over time was distress at baseline. Other predictors were gender, age, civil status, and social support. Conclusions: Emotional distress tended to decrease for most patients in this cohort, but a minority showed continuously high levels. Patients at higher risk of developing emotional distress over time had higher levels of distress at baseline, were younger, more often female, and cohabiting, and experienced less social support. © 2005 Taylor & Francis on license from Scandinavian Rheumatology Research Foundation.},

The current system in this sector is not well known and understood, e.g., in terms of seasonal variability, across-shore structure, forcing processes. This knowledge gap is addressed in a suite of two studies that analyze the mean seasonal cycle of an eddy-permitting numerical simulation of the tropical Atlantic. Part 1 is concerned with the circulation over the West African continental slope at the outmost reach of the Canary current system, between ∼&thinsp;10 and 20&deg;&thinsp;N. The focus is on the depth range most directly implicated in the wind-driven circulation (offshore/coastal upwellings and Sverdrup transport), located above the potential density &sigma;t&thinsp;=&thinsp;26.7&thinsp;kg&thinsp;m&minus;3 in the model (approx. above 250&thinsp;m depth). In this sector and for this depth range, the flow is predominantly poleward as a direct consequence of positive wind stress curl forcing, but the degree to which the magnitude of the upper ocean poleward transport reflects Sverdrup theory varies with latitude. The model poleward flow also exhibits a marked semi-annual cycle with transport maxima in spring and fall. Dynamical rationalizations of these characteristics are offered in terms of wind forcing of coastal trapped waves and Rossby wave dynamics. Remote forcing by seasonal fluctuations of coastal winds in the Guinea Gulf play an instrumental role in the fall intensification of the poleward flow. The spring intensification appears to be related to wind fluctuations taking place at shorter distances, north of the Guinea Gulf entrance and also locally. Rossby wave activity accompanying the semi-annual fluctuations of the poleward flow in the coastal wave guide varies greatly with latitude, which in turn, exerts a major influence on the vertical structure of the poleward flow. Although the realism of the model West African boundary currents is difficult to determine precisely, the present in-depth investigation provides a renewed framework for future observational programs in the region.},

By using a surface-forced ocean and sea-ice coupled model, we show that regional wind-driven ocean dynam-ics played a key role in driving these trends. In the East Pacific, the strengthening Southern Hemisphere (SH) westerlies in the region enhanced the Ekman upwelling of warm upper Circumpolar Deep Water and increased the northward Ekman transport of cold Antarctic surface water. The associated surface ocean warming south of 688S and the cooling north of 688S directly contributed to the retreat of sea-ice in warm seasons and the expansion in cold seasons, respectively. In the Atlantic, the poleward shifting SH westerlies in the region strengthened the northern branch of the Weddell Gyre, which in turn increased the meridional thermal gradient across it as constrained by the thermal wind balance. Ocean heat budget analysis further suggests that the strengthened northern branch of the Weddell Gyre acted as a barrier against the pole-ward ocean heat transport, and thus produced anomalous heat divergence within the Weddell Gyre and anomalous heat convergence north of the gyre. The associated cooling within the Weddell Gyre and the warming north of the gyre contributed to the expansion of sea-ice in warm seasons and the retreat in cold seasons, respectively.},

Comparison of GECCO with time-mean observational estimates of density and meridional currents at 10°S and 10°N, which represent the boundaries between the tropics and subtropics in GECCO, shows good agreement in transports of major currents. The variability of the GECCO wind stress in the interior at 10°S and 10°N remains consistent with the NCEP forcing, although temporary changes can be large. On pentadal and longer time scales, an STC loop response is found between the poleward Ekman divergence and STC-layer convergence at 10°S and 10°N via the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) at 23°W, where the divergence leads the EUC and the convergence, suggesting a “pulling” mechanism via equatorial upwelling.

   abstract = {[ 1] A suite of basin-scale models of the thermohaline and wind-driven circulation in the Atlantic Ocean is used to study the mechanisms of decadal variability in the shallow subtropical-tropical cells (STCs). The emphasis is on the spatial patterns of the transport anomalies in the tropical thermocline, particularly their manifestation in the equatorial current system and on the relative role of changes in the deep meridional overturning cell (MOC) associated with variations in the formation of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) in the subpolar North Atlantic. Using wind stress and heat flux variations based on NCEP/ NCAR-reanalysis products, the variability of the zonally integrated STC transports is similar to that obtained in a recent regional model study, corroborating the role of both the southern and northern STC in supporting wind-driven transport anomalies of O(2 Sv) near the equator. Sensitivity experiments indicate that changes in subarctic MOC transports associated with the strong variability in LSW formation during the last decades contributed a signal of O( 0.3Sv) to the upper-layer equatorial transports. Whereas the local wind-driven variability clearly dominates on interannual-decadal timescales and is confined to depths down to 150 m, the weak MOC-related signal is primarily reflected in an interdecadal modulation of the STC transports. While a strong part in the STC's transport anomalies is associated with the western boundary current (NBC), there is an important contribution also by weaker, interior ocean flow anomalies which tend to counteract the variability of the NBC.},

   abstract = {The equatorial SST dipole represents a mode of climate variability in the tropical Atlantic Ocean that is closely tied to cross-equatorial flow in the atmosphere, from the cold to the warm hemisphere. It has been suggested that this mode is sustained by a positive feedback of the tropical winds on the cross-equatorial SST gradient. The role, if any, of the tropical ocean is the focus of this investigation, which shows that at the latitudes of the SST signal (centered on 10?N/S) there is a weak positive feedback suggested in data from the last half century, that the cross-equatorial wind stress is closely coupled to this SST gradient on monthly time scales with no discernable lag, and that the period from January to June is the most active period for coupling. Northward (southward) anomalies of cross-equatorial wind stress are associated with a substantial negative (positive) wind stress curl. This wind system can thus drive a cross-equatorial Sverdrup transport in the ocean from the warm to the cold side of the equator (opposite the winds) with a temporal lag of only a few months. The oceanic observations of subsurface temperature and a numerical model hindcast also indicate a clear relationship between this mode of wind-driven variability and changes in the zonal transport of the North Equatorial Countercurrent. It is estimated that the time-dependent oceanic flow is capable of providing a significant contribution to the damping of the SST dipole but that external forcing is essential to sustaining the coupled variability.},

Two well-defined transport maxima are found: One, present during boreal summer and autumn in the central part of the basin, is generally recognized and regarded as a near-equilibrium response to the equatorial easterly trades that culminate in this period. Another one, most pronounced near the western boundary, occurs in April May when the trades relax. This second maximum is less patent in the observations, but concomitant signals in previously published analyses of the North Brazil Current and surface velocity seasonal variations might be indirect manifestations of its reality. Because this intensification appears at periods when the boundary between the tropical and equatorial gyres nears the equator, the authors relate its existence to wind stress curl variations at subequatorial latitudes. A link between the interannual variability of the spring transport maximum and that of the low-latitude wind stress curl is, indeed, found in the model. This diagnostic approach suggests that two different dynamical regimes shape up the EUC seasonal cycle: in summer and autumn, local forcing by the equatorial zonal wind component and main supply from the ocean interior; in winter and spring, remote forcing by the low-latitude rotational wind component and supply from the western boundary currents.},

Here we use a set of hindcast, sensitivity, and perturbation experiments performed within a hierarchy of ocean general circulation models to show that decadal to multidecadal buoyancy-forced changes in the basin-scale AMOC transport indeed manifest themselves in the NBC.

On interannual time scales, highest SST variability occurs in the eastern equatorial region and off the coast of southwestern Africa. The pattern of SST variability resembles the Pacific El Niño, but features notable differences, and has been discussed in the context of various climate modes, that is, reoccurring patterns resulting from particular interactions in the climate system. Here, we attempt to reconcile those different definitions, concluding that almost all of them are essentially describing the same mode that we refer to as the ?Atlantic Niño.? We give an overview of the mechanisms that have been proposed to underlie this mode, and we discuss its interaction with other climate modes within and outside the tropical Atlantic. The impact of Atlantic Niño?related SST variability on rainfall, in particular over the Gulf of Guinea and north eastern South America is also described. An important aspect we highlight is that the Atlantic Niño and its teleconnections are not stationary, but subject to multidecadal modulations. Simulating the Atlantic Niño proves a challenge for state?of?the?art climate models, and this may be partly due to the large mean state biases in the region. Potential reasons for these model biases and implications for seasonal prediction are discussed. This article is categorized under: Climate Models and Modeling > Knowledge Generation with Models},

In all simulations, which are consistent with observed standing stocks of relevant biogeochemical species at the surface, we find spuriously enhanced (reduced) macronutrient (oxygen) concentrations in the deep eastern equatorial Pacific. This modeling problem, apparently endemic to global coupled biogeochemical ocean circulation models, was coined “nutrient trapping” by Najjar et al. (1992). In contrast to Aumont et al. (1999), we argue that “nutrient trapping” is still a persistent problem, even in eddy-permitting models and, further, that the scale of the problem retards model projections of nitrogen cycling. In line with previous work, our results indicate that a deficient circulation is at the core of the problem rather than an admittedly poor quantitative understanding of biogeochemical cycles. More specifically, we present indications that “nutrient trapping” in models is a result of a spuriously damped Equatorial Intermediate (zonal) Current System and Equatorial Deep Jets—phenomenon which await a comprehensive understanding and have, to date, not been successfully simulated.},

   abstract = {A simplified coupled ocean-atmosphere model, where an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) is fully coupled to a 21/2-layer reduced-gravity ocean model (RGO) over the tropical Atlantic basin, is presented in the context of studying the role of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in tropical Atlantic variability (TAV). In the ocean model, the strength of the AMOC is controlled by specifying mass transport at open boundaries. The fidelity of the reduced-physics model in capturing major features of tropical Atlantic variability, as well as its response to the AMOC changes, is demonstrated in a series of model experiments. The results of the experiments reveal the relative importance of oceanic processes and atmospheric processes in AMOC-induced tropical Atlantic variability-change. It is found that the oceanic processes are a primary factor contributing to the warming at and south of the equator and the precipitation increase over the Gulf of Guinea, while atmospheric processes are responsible for the surface cooling of the tropical North Atlantic and southward displacement of ITCZ. A systematic investigation of the coupled systemresponse to changes in AMOC strength indicates that the SST over the cold-tongue region responds nonlinearly to AMOC changes. The sensitivity of the SST response increases rapidly when AMOC strength decreases below a threshold value. Such nonlinear behavior is also found in precipitation response over the Gulf of Guinea. These results suggest that complex and competing atmosphere-ocean processes are involved in TAV response to AMOC changes and the nature of the response can vary from one region to another. This complexity should be taken into consideration in Atlantic abrupt climate studies. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

However, the observations as well as the 1/12�-FLAME model computations indicate that a lot of eddy scale variability is superimposed on the mean flow field. Despite of the disturbance by variability the signature of the Guinea Dome is well present. In November 2002 the Guinea Dome transport from direct observations was about 2.8 Sv above &#963; $\theta$ = 25.8 kg/m3 and 4 Sv between &#963; $\theta$ = 25.8 and 27.1 kg/m3. The oxygen minimum in the shadow zone comprises the central water and the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) layers and is located between the equatorial current system and the North Equatorial Current. The North Equatorial Counter- and Undercurrents at 3� to 6�N are major oxygen sources for the central water layer of the low-oxygen regions in the northeastern tropical Atlantic. A second, northern North Equatorial Countercurrent (nNECC) band exists at 8� to 10�N. The nNECC carries oxygen rich water from the southern hemisphere eastward but with an admixture of water from the northern hemisphere. A float at 200 m depth was spreading eastward in the North Equatorial Undercurrent (NEUC), at 28�W it shifted northward into the nNECC, and then was trapped in the Guinea Dome region for more than 3 years. The model indicates the region 22� to 32�W as the area of exchange between the NECC/NEUC and the nNECC bands. In the AAIW layer the northern Intermediate Countercurrent acts as oxygen source for the oxygen minimum zone.},

   abstract = {The West African seaboard is one of the upwelling sectors that has received the least attention and in situ observations relevant to its dynamics are particularly scarce. The current system in this sector is not well known and understood, e.g., in terms of seasonal variability, across-shore structure, forcing processes. This knowledge gap is addressed in a suite of two studies that analyze the mean seasonal cycle of an eddy-permitting numerical simulation of the tropical Atlantic. Part 1 is concerned with the circulation over the West African continental slope at the outmost reach of the Canary current system, between ∼&thinsp;10 and 20&deg;&thinsp;N. The focus is on the depth range most directly implicated in the wind-driven circulation (offshore/coastal upwellings and Sverdrup transport), located above the potential density &sigma;t&thinsp;=&thinsp;26.7&thinsp;kg&thinsp;m&minus;3 in the model (approx. above 250&thinsp;m depth). In this sector and for this depth range, the flow is predominantly poleward as a direct consequence of positive wind stress curl forcing, but the degree to which the magnitude of the upper ocean poleward transport reflects Sverdrup theory varies with latitude. The model poleward flow also exhibits a marked semi-annual cycle with transport maxima in spring and fall. Dynamical rationalizations of these characteristics are offered in terms of wind forcing of coastal trapped waves and Rossby wave dynamics. Remote forcing by seasonal fluctuations of coastal winds in the Guinea Gulf play an instrumental role in the fall intensification of the poleward flow. The spring intensification appears to be related to wind fluctuations taking place at shorter distances, north of the Guinea Gulf entrance and also locally. Rossby wave activity accompanying the semi-annual fluctuations of the poleward flow in the coastal wave guide varies greatly with latitude, which in turn, exerts a major influence on the vertical structure of the poleward flow. Although the realism of the model West African boundary currents is difficult to determine precisely, the present in-depth investigation provides a renewed framework for future observational programs in the region.},

Here, a report is presented on the first experience with this instrument in two very different current regimes, in the Tropics with large vertical shears, and in the subpolar regime with mainly barotropic flow. The ocean surveyor continuously measured currents in the upper ocean from near the surface to about 500–700-m depth. The measurement range showed a dependence on the regional and temporal variations of scattering particles and on the intensity of swell and wind waves. Statistical comparisons are performed with on-station lowered acoustic Doppler current profiler (LADCP) profiles and underway measurements by classic shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements. Accuracy estimates for hourly averaged ocean surveyor currents result in errors of about 1 cm s?1 for on-station data and of 2–4 cm s?1 for underway measurements, depending on the regional abundance of scatterers and on the weather conditions encountered.},

The data processing, however, is still in a rather primitive state. First, a method to estimate bottom-track velocities using the standard water profile data was developed. Then inverse solutions are presented that enhance the standard data processing by adding external constraints such as bottom-referenced velocity profiles. Depending on the depth of the profile and the ADCP range the inclusion of bottom-track data can reduce the local velocity errors by a significant factor. The least squares framework also allows for simplified error analysis of the LADCP system and some of the trade-offs are discussed.},

Simulations with this atmospheric forcing are presented from seven global ocean-ice models using the CORE-I design (repeating annual cycle of atmospheric forcing for 500 years). These simulations test the hypothesis that global ocean-ice models run under the same atmospheric state produce qualitatively similar simulations. The validity of this hypothesis is shown to depend on the chosen diagnostic.

   abstract = {Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin of the trichothecene family commonly found in cereals infested with different Fusarium species. DON acts primarily on the gastrointestinal and immune system and is suspected to be an underlying agent causing several outbreaks of gastrointestinal disorder among humans, which prompts studies of human exposure and estimations of intake among populations. However, assessing human exposure to mycotoxins is associated with several difficulties. Therefore, a study was undertaken among adults (18-80 years) in a subgroup of Riksmaten, the Swedish national survey investigating dietary habits, examining both the association between urinary DON concentration and dietary intake of cereals, and estimations of daily DON intake. The results indicate that exposure to DON is common among Swedish adults, as this mycotoxin was detected in 292 out of 326 urine samples (90%) at levels ranging from non-detectable to 65.8 ng DON/ml urine with a median level of 2.9 ng/ml. Furthermore, urinary DON (ng/mg creatinine) was associated with intake (g/day) of total cereal grain as well as whole grain. Urinary DON was also significantly associated with breakfast cereals and porridge consumption (P<0.05). Estimated DON intake in this study ranged between 2.5 and 5,443 ng/kg body weight (bw). 1% of the individuals had estimated intakes above the group provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI; 1 µg/kg), whereas the mean and median intakes of 159 and 84 ng DON/kg bw, respectively, were considerably below the PMTDI. Along with the toxicological profile of DON, no serious health implications are to be expected for the majority of Swedish adults, although a potential health concern remains for some high cereal consumers. In conclusion, biomonitoring could prove to be a valuable tool for observing DON exposure among populations.},

   abstract = {<p>In addition to being one of the most productive upwelling systems, the oceanic region off Peru is embedded in one of the most extensive Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) of the world ocean. The dynamics of the OMZ off Peru remain uncertain, partly due to the scarcity of data and to the ubiquitous role of mesoscale activity on the circulation and biogeochemistry. Here we use a high-resolution coupled physical/biogeochemical model simulation to investigate the seasonal variability of the OMZ off Peru. The focus is on characterizing the seasonal cycle in Dissolved O<sub>2</sub> (DO) eddy flux at the OMZ boundaries, including the coastal domain, viewed here as the eastern boundary of the OMZ, considering that the mean DO eddy flux in these zones has a significant contribution to the total DO flux. Along the coast, despite the increased seasonal low DO water upwelling, the DO peaks homogeneously over the water column and within the Peru Undercurrent (PUC) in austral winter, which results from mixing associated with the increase in both the intraseasonal wind variability and baroclinic instability of the PUC. The coastal ocean acts therefore as a source of DO in austral winter for the OMZ core through eddy-induced offshore transport that is also shown to peak in Austral winter. In the open ocean, the OMZ can be divided vertically into two zones: an upper zone above 400m where DO eddy flux dominates over the mean seasonal DO flux, and varies seasonally, and a lower part where DO exhibits vertical-zonal propagating features and where the mean seasonal DO flux shares similar characteristics than those of the energy flux associated with the annual extra-tropical Rossby waves. At the OMZ meridional boundaries where the mean eddy flux is large, the DO eddy flux has also a marked seasonal cycle that peaks in austral winter (spring) at the northern (southern) boundary. In the model, the amplitude of the seasonal cycle is 67% larger at the southern boundary than at the northern boundary. Results implications for understanding the OMZ variability at longer timescales are discussed.</p>},

We show that the spatial extent of hypoxia is highly sensitive to small changes in the ocean's O(2) content, with maximum responses at suboxic concentrations where anaerobic metabolisms predominate. In model-based reconstructions of historical oxygen changes, the world's largest suboxic zone, in the Pacific Ocean, varies in size by a factor of 2. This is attributable to climate-driven changes in the depth of the tropical and subtropical thermocline that have multiplicative effects on respiration rates in low-O(2) water. The same mechanism yields even larger fluctuations in the rate of nitrogen removal by denitrification, creating a link between decadal climate oscillations and the nutrient limitation of marine photosynthesis.},

Increasing d15N since ~1990 records an expansion of anoxia, consistent with observed O2 trends. However, this was preceded by a longer declining d15N trend that implies that the anoxic zone was shrinking for most of the 20th century. Both periods can be explained by changes in winds over the tropical Pacific that drive upwelling, biological productivity, and O2 demand within the OMZ. If equatorial Pacific winds resume their predicted weakening trend, the ocean’s largest anoxic zone will contract despite a global O2 decline.},

Climate models consistently confirm this decline and predict continuing and accelerating ocean deoxygenation. However, current models (1) do not reproduce observed patterns for oxygen changes in the ocean’s thermocline; (2) underestimate the temporal variability of oxygen concentrations and air–sea fluxes inferred from time-series observations; and (3) generally simulate only about half the oceanic oxygen loss inferred from observations. We here review current knowledge about the mechanisms and drivers of oxygen changes and their variation with region and depth over the world’s oceans. Warming is considered a major driver: in part directly, via solubility effects, and in part indirectly, via changes in circulation, mixing and oxygen respiration. While solubility effects have been quantified and found to dominate deoxygenation near the surface, a quantitative understanding of contributions from other mechanisms is still lacking. Current models may underestimate deoxygenation because of unresolved transport processes, unaccounted for variations in respiratory oxygen demand, or missing biogeochemical feedbacks. Dedicated observational programmes are required to better constrain biological and physical processes and their representation in models to improve our understanding and predictions of patterns and intensity of future oxygen change.},

Observations are presented from six cruises, one conducted in August 1989 and the other five conducted during the Western Tropical Atlantic Experiment between January 1990 and September 1991. The upper water column is divided into two layers, an upper thermocline layer located between the surface and the 24.5 σθ isopycnal surface and a lower subthermocline layer located between the 24.5 and 26.75 isopycnals. In the upper layer the NEC retrofiects north of the equator to form the eastward flowing North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC). During the six cruises the retroflection appeared complete. However, data coverage did not extend shoreward of the 200-m isobath, so the possibility of a continuous flow over the shelf still remains. There were also indications of several NEC rings that had apparently separated from the NEC retroflection and drifted to the northwest toward the eastern Caribbean Sea. North of the NEC retroflection and the NECC, the North Equatorial Current (NEC) flows west as the southern limb of the subtropical gyre. Part of the NEC is observed to retroflect cyclonically to join the eastward NECC flow. In the lower layer, beneath the NEC, the North Brazil Undercurrent retrofiects to feed the eastward North Equatorial Undercurrent (NEUC).

   abstract = {Observational estimates and numerical models both indicate a significant overall decline in marine oxygen levels over the past few decades. Spatial patterns of oxygen change, however, differ considerably between observed and modelled estimates. Particularly in the tropical thermocline that hosts open-ocean oxygen minimum zones, observations indicate a general oxygen decline, whereas most of the state-of-the-art models simulate increasing oxygen levels. Possible reasons for the apparent model-data discrepancies are examined. In order to attribute observed historical variations in oxygen levels, we here study mechanisms of changes in oxygen supply and consumption with sensitivity model simulations. Specifically, the role of equatorial jets, of lateral and diapycnal mixing processes, of changes in the wind-driven circulation and atmospheric nutrient supply, and of some poorly constrained biogeochemical processes are investigated. Predominantly wind-driven changes in the low-latitude oceanic ventilation are identified as a possible factor contributing to observed oxygen changes in the low-latitude thermocline during the past decades, while the potential role of biogeochemical processes remains difficult to constrain. We discuss implications for the attribution of observed oxygen changes to anthropogenic impacts and research priorities that may help to improve our mechanistic understanding of oxygen changes and the quality of projections into a changing future.This article is part of the themed issue 'Ocean ventilation and deoxygenation in a warming world'.},

   abstract = {The Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) hosts two of the world's three Oxygen Deficient Zones (ODZs), large bodies of suboxic water that are subject to high rates of water column denitrification (WCD). In the mean, these two ODZs are responsible for about 15 to 40% of all fixed N loss in the ocean, but little is known about how this loss varies in time. Here we use a hindcast simulation with the ocean component of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model over the period 1948 to 2009 to show that the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drives large variations in the rates of WCD in this region. During mature La Niña (El Niño) conditions, peak denitrification rates are up to 70% higher (lower) than the mean rates. This large variability is the result of wind-driven changes in circulation and isopycnal structure concurrently modifying the thermocline distribution of O 2 and organic matter export in such a way that the response of WCD is strongly amplified. During average La Niña (El Niño) conditions, the overall changes in ODZ structure and primarily the shoaling (deepening) of the upper boundary of both ODZs by 40 to 100 m explains 50% of the changes in WCD in the North Pacific and 94% in the South Pacific. Such a large variability of WCD in the ETP has strong implications for the assessments of trends, the balance of the marine N cycle and the emission of the greenhouse gas N 2 O.},

   abstract = {Abstract. We analyse simulations of the Pacific Ocean oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) from 11 Earth system model contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, focusing on the mean state and climate change projections. The simulations tend to overestimate the volume of the OMZs, especially in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere. Compared to observations, five models introduce incorrect meridional asymmetries in the distribution of oxygen including larger southern OMZ and weaker northern OMZ, due to interhemispheric biases in intermediate water mass ventilation. Seven models show too deep an extent of the tropical hypoxia compared to observations, stemming from a deficient equatorial ventilation in the upper ocean, combined with too large a biologically driven downward flux of particulate organic carbon at depth, caused by particle export from the euphotic layer that is too high and remineralization in the upper ocean that is too weak. At interannual timescales, the dynamics of oxygen in the eastern tropical Pacific OMZ is dominated by biological consumption and linked to natural variability in the Walker circulation. However, under the climate change scenario RCP8.5, all simulations yield small and discrepant changes in oxygen concentration at mid depths in the tropical Pacific by the end of the 21st century due to an almost perfect compensation between warming-related decrease in oxygen saturation and decrease in biological oxygen utilization. Climate change projections are at odds with recent observations that show decreasing oxygen levels at mid depths in the tropical Pacific. Out of the OMZs, all the CMIP5 models predict a decrease of oxygen over most of the surface and deep ocean at low latitudes and over all depths at high latitudes due to an overall slow-down of ventilation and increased temperature.},

   abstract = {Eastward subsurface countercurrents (SSCCs) are observed in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans on either side of the equator, and are associated with a poleward shoaling of subthermocline isotherms at the poleward flanks of the equatorial 13°C thermostad. Observations suggest that eastward SSCCs correspond to a meridional circulation of subthermocline tropical cells (STTCs). The STTCs are below and weaker than the tropical cells, being characterized by an equatorward flow in the thermocline, an equatorial downwelling, a poleward flow in the subthermocline, and an upwelling about 3-4°from the equator. The essential dynamics of the SSCCs can be explained in terms of the conservation of absolute vorticity in the poleward flow of the lower branch of the STTCs. As a parcel within the subthermocline moves poleward, its gain of planetary vorticity is compensated by a loss of relative vorticity, resulting in the eastward SSCCs. By applying the conservation of potential vorticity, the paper also shows that the poleward shoaling of subthermocline isotherms at the poleward flanks of the thermostad can contribute to the eastward SSCCs.},

The measurements allow for the first time a description of the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of the EUC across the Atlantic basin. The mean transport of the EUC at 23°W is 14.3 ± 0.6 Sv, decreasing to 12.1 ± 0.9 and 9.4 ± 0.6 Sv at 10°W and 0°E, respectively. The EUC shows a changing seasonal cycle across the basin: at 23°W, the strongest EUC transport occurs in boreal fall in association with maximum easterly wind stress, at 10°W the EUC transport shows a semiannual cycle with a maximum in boreal spring and fall, while at 0°E the EUC has a single spring maximum. At all locations the EUC core exhibits a similar seasonal vertical migration, with shallowest core depths occurring in boreal spring and deepest core depths in boreal fall. The maximum core intensity occurs in boreal spring all across the basin, when the EUC is shallow, during the annual wind relaxation. The weakest EUC core intensity occurs during the boreal summer cold tongue phase, especially in the eastern part of the basin. At both 23°W and 10°W, a deep extension of the EUC occurs in boreal summer, which increases the transport in the lower thermocline and partially offsets the weaker upper EUC transport during boreal summer. No clear linkage could be established between the interannual variability of the EUC in the eastern part of the basin and the intensity of the summer cold tongue, despite evidence for such a linkage in the western part of the basin. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {In the mid-20th century, food production from agriculture sharply increased worldwide; however, this was achieved through heavy use of agrochemicals. Extensive collateral damage from excessive use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers has occurred to the wider environment. This has led to biodiversity loss, pesticide resistance and the emergence of new pests, pollution and decline of freshwater supplies, and soil degradation and erosion, as well as direct harm to health. In a Review, Pretty examines the alternative approaches that can achieve sustainable intensification of farming systems by integrating pest management with agroecological systems to minimize costs, maximize yields, restore ecosystem services, and ensure environmental enhancement.

Science , this issue p. [eaav0294][1]

### BACKGROUND

The mid-20th century brought agricultural transformation and the “Green Revolution.” New crop varieties and livestock breeds—combined with increased use of inorganic fertilizers, manufactured pesticides, and machinery—led to sharp increases in food production from agriculture worldwide. Yet this period of agricultural intensification was accompanied by considerable harm to the environment. This imposed costs on economies and made agricultural systems less efficient by degrading ecosystem goods and services. The desire for agriculture to produce more food without environmental harm, and even to make positive contributions to natural and social capital, has been reflected in many calls for more sustainable agriculture. Sustainable intensification (SI) comprises agricultural processes or systems in which production is maintained or increased while progressing toward substantial enhancement of environmental outcomes. It incorporates these principles without the cultivation of more land and loss of unfarmed habitats and with increases in system performance that incur no net environmental cost.

SI seeks to develop synergies between agricultural and landscape-wide system components and is now a priority for the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. The concept is open; emphasizes outcomes rather than means; can be applied to any size of enterprise; and does not predetermine technologies, production type, or design components. SI can thus be distinguished from earlier manifestations of intensification because of the explicit emphasis on a wider set of environmental as well as socially progressive outcomes. Central to SI is an acceptance that there will be no perfect end point. No designed system is expected to succeed forever, and no single package of practices is able to fit the dynamics of every ecosystem.

### ADVANCES

Three nonlinear stages in transition toward sustainability have been proposed to occur: efficiency, substitution, and redesign. Although both efficiency and substitution are important, they are not sufficient for maximizing coproduction of favorable agricultural and beneficial environmental outcomes without redesign. Whereas efficiency and substitution tend to be additive and incremental within current production systems, redesign should be the most transformative. Redesign presents social and institutional as well as agricultural challenges.

It is now clear that SI is spreading to increasing numbers of farmers and is being practiced on a growing area of farmland. By 2018, it was estimated from these initiatives that across some 100 countries, 163 million farms had crossed an important substitution-redesign threshold by using SI methods in at least one farm enterprise, and over an area approaching 453 million ha of agricultural land. This is equivalent to 29% of all farms worldwide and 9% of agricultural land.

### OUTLOOK

Pest management exemplifies the need for continuing active intervention for SI; the job is never done. Ecological and economic conditions will change, and agroecosystems will have to be adaptable in order to deliver a range of ecosystem services, including food production but also water and soil conservation, soil carbon storage, nutrient recycling, and pest control. Cooperation—or at least individual actions that collectively result in additive or synergistic benefits—is needed for SI to have a transformative impact across landscapes. Farmers will have to be given the confidence to innovate in a flexible way as conditions change. Every example of successful redesign for SI at scale has involved the prior building of social capital. Widespread adoption of IPM needs new knowledge economies for agriculture. Technologies and practices are growing, but new knowledge needs to be collectively created and deployed and needs to give equal emphasis to ecological and technological innovations. The concept and practice embodied in the SI model of agriculture will be a process of adaptation, driven by a wide range of actors cooperating in new agricultural knowledge economies.

SI at the landscape scale.
In most landscapes worldwide, SI requires engagements by large numbers of farmers to deliver both productivity improvements and benefits to ecosystem services. Redesign will be a continuing effort of transformation and improvement.



Redesign of agricultural systems is essential to deliver optimum outcomes as ecological and economic conditions change. The combination of agricultural processes in which production is maintained or increased, while environmental outcomes are enhanced, is currently known as sustainable intensification (SI). SI aims to avoid the cultivation of more land, and thus avoid the loss of unfarmed habitats, but also aims to increase overall system performance without net environmental cost. For example, large changes are now beginning to occur to maximize biodiversity by means of integrated pest management, pasture and forage management, the incorporation of trees into agriculture, and irrigation management, and with small and patch systems. SI is central to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and to wider efforts to improve global food and nutritional security.

   abstract = {The flow field in the area of what was thought to be the source region of the North Brazil Current (NBC) off the northeast coast of Brazil between 5°30'S and 10°S was investigated in austral spring during November 1992 and compared with observations in October 1990. The data were taken with several different instruments, including vessel-mounted ADCP, lowered-ADCP, Pegasus, CTD and XBTs. The flow was found off the coast at 5°30'S as well as at 10°S as an undercurrent, the North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC). The NBUC shows a subsurface core at about 200 m depth with velocities of up to 90.0 cm s -', resulting in large northward transports of more than 22 Sv in the upper 1000 m. The transport is about the same at 5°30'S and 10°S, hence no net inflow from the east is required to feed the NBUC. The climatological Ekman transport is to the south between 5°30'S and 10°S, and in consequence the northward flow near the surface was reduced and might be one reason for the existence of the undercurrent. The flow near the coast was to the north at 10°S, therefore the Brazil Current had to start as a coastal current south of 10°S. For the zonal sections at 5°30'S and 10°S the geostrophic computations relative to the density surface a, = 32.15 kg m-=` (about 1150 m depth) resulted in transports comparable to those obtained from direct measurements. The results further show that the choice of a correct level of no motion can be supported by the direct observations. A shallower reference based on water mass boundaries alone would reduce the NBUC transport to almost zero. Computations with data from the historical data base for austral fall resulted in a weaker NBUC of less than 20 Sv near 10°S, indicating a possible seasonal signal in the NBUC with a stronger NBUC in austral spring. © 1995.},

At 5°S, the mean from nine sections yields an NBUC transport of 26.5  3.7 Sv (Sv  106 m3 s1) along the boundary; at 11°S the mean NBUC transport from five sections is 25.4  7.4 Sv, confirming that the NBUC is already well developed at 11°S. At both latitudes a persistent offshore southward recirculation between 200- and 1100-m depth reduces the net northward warm water flow through the 5°S section (west of 31.5°W) to 22.15.3 Sv and through the 11°S section to 21.74.1 Sv (west of 32.0°W). The 4-yr-long NBUC transport time series from 11°S yields a seasonal cycle of 2.5 Sv amplitude with its northward maximum in July. Interannual NBUC transport variations are small, varying only by 1.2 Sv during the four years, with no detectable trend. The southward flow of NADW within the deep western boundary current at 5°S is 25.5  8.3 Sv with an offshore northward recirculation, yielding a nine-section mean of 20.3  10.1 Sv west of 31.5°W. For Antarctic Bottom Water, a net northward flow of 4.4  3.0 Sv is determined at 5°S. For the 11°S section, the moored array data show a pronounced energy maximum at 60–70-day period in the NADW depth range, which was identified in related work as deep eddies translating southward along the boundary. Based on a kinematic eddy model fit to the first half of the moored time series, the mean NADW transfer by the deep eddies at 11°S was estimated to be about 17 Sv. Given the large interannual variability of the deep near-boundary transport time series, which ranged from 14 to 24 Sv, the 11°S mean was considered to be not distinguishable from the mean at 5°S.},

   abstract = {Pathways of subtropical cells (STCs) and the basin-wide meridional overturning circulation (MOC) are studied in the tropical Atlantic using a particle tracking algorithm and transports from a high-resolution ocean model. Here 16 Sv (=106 m3 s-1) of MOC water flows to the equator from the south, primarily in the North Brazil Current. The MOC water recirculates in the tropics and, after crossing the equator about half of it, stays along the western boundary and the other half loops in a cyclonic circulation northward to join the North Equatorial Current. The STC on the Southern Hemisphere has a strength of 4 Sv. The northern STC has a strength of 1.5 Sv; it is confined to the retroflection area close to the equator and it contains primarily MOC water. In total, 5.5 Sv of MOC water entrains into the mixed layer in the tropical Atlantic. Here 2 Sv of MOC water recirculates in the southern STC and 1.5 Sv in the northern STC. The STCs are weaker than suggested from observations, but the interior flows in the model compare well to observations. The heat transport divergence that is associated with warming of MOC water masses between 10°S and 10°N is 0.22 PW (=1015W). The fresh water transport divergence of MOC water masses in the tropical Atlantic is 0.16 Sv. It is concluded that the MOC can substantially affect the tropical circulation, but the tropical circulation itself can also affect MOC properties. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Here, we calculate the NBC geostrophic transport time series based on 5 decades of observations near the western boundary off the coast of Brazil. Results reveal a multidecadal NBC variability that lags Labrador Sea deep convection by a few years. The NBC transport time series is coherent with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in sea surface temperature, which also has been widely linked to AMOC fluctuations in previous modeling studies. Our results thus suggest that the observed multidecadal NBC transport variability is a useful indicator for AMOC variations. The suggested connection between the NBC and AMOC is assessed in a 700 year control simulation of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's CM2.1 coupled climate model. The model results are in agreement with observations and further demonstrate that the variability of NBC transport is a good index for tracking AMOC variations. Concerning the debate about whether a slowdown of AMOC has already occurred under global warming, the observed NBC transport time series suggests strong multidecadal variability but no significant trend.},

The observational basis for linking water mass formation with the ocean's meridional overturning is reviewed herein.

   abstract = {Atlantic meridional overturning circulation(AMOC)variability is documented in the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4) preindustrial control simulation that uses nominal 18 horizontal resolution in all its components. AMOC shows a broad spectrum of low-frequency variability covering the 50–200-yr range, contrasting sharply with the multidecadal variability seen in the T85 3 1 resolution CCSM3 present- day control simulation. Furthermore, the amplitude of variability is much reduced in CCSM4 compared to that of CCSM3. Similarities as well as differences in AMOC variability mechanisms between CCSM3 and CCSM4are discussed.As inCCSM3,theCCSM4AMOCvariability is primarily driven by the positive density anomalies at the Labrador Sea (LS) deep-water formation site, peaking 2 yr prior to anAMOCmaximum.All processes, including parameterized mesoscale and submesoscale eddies, play a role in the creation of salinity anomalies thatdominate these density anomalies.HighNordicSea densities donot necessarily leadtoincreased overflow transports because the overflow physics is governed by source and interior region density differences. Increased overflow transports do not lead to a higher AMOC either but instead appear to be a precursor to lower AMOC transports through enhanced stratification in LS. This has important implications for decadal prediction studies. TheNorthAtlanticOscillation (NAO) is significantly correlated with the positive boundary layer depth and density anomalies prior to anAMOC maximum. This suggests a role forNAOthrough setting the surface flux anomalies in LS and affecting the subpolar gyre circulation strength.},

This mode has a corresponding period of 40 – 50 years and affects the variability in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the North Brazil Current (NBC). Using multi-channel singular spectral analysis on the POP output, also multidecadal variability was found in the NBC. This result suggests a teleconnection between the Southern Ocean and the NBC. The northward propagating multidecadal signal is clearly visible in SSH in the Southern Ocean, but submerges at 40 • S. Anomalies in ocean heat content and temperature are observed between 40 • – 5 • S, at depths up to 1 km, and re-emerge near the equator where the anomalies propagate towards the NBC. This provides the evidence that the multidecadal signal found in the NBC has a Southern Ocean origin, and hence connected to the SOM.},

   abstract = {Near-surface current velocity data from the Pilot Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic at 23�W in the year 2002 were re-examined and compared to simultaneous unpublished velocity data at 10�W, near the surface. Strong 7-day-period fluctuations were observed in the zonal velocity component and in temperature records at 23�W. The large temperature fluctuations near the thermocline depth suggest a vertical velocity component at the same 7-day period. The 7-day-period signals occurred in June/July simultaneously with the seasonal upwelling. The meridional velocity component presented similar spectral contents at 23�W and at 10�W. Two distinguishable quasiperiodic signals were observed in the meridional component at both locations: The first signal occurred in the spring, had a periodicity of about 14 days, was subsurface intensified, and had the characteristics of a mixed Rossby-gravity wave. The second signal occurred three times in the year (once in winter 2001&#8211;2002, another in summer, and another during fall 2002), had a periodicity of about 20 days, was strongest close to the surface, and was the result of the passage of tropical instability waves (TIWs). Satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data show the same periodicities as the meridional velocity records, and present a spatial structure in accordance with the TIW-SST signature. The summer of 2002 showed different TIW-SST patterns depending upon location, suggesting the existence of different types of TIWs. Overall, variability in the current meter data for the year 2002 was mainly due to current instabilities, except around boreal spring, where intraseasonal variability in surface winds was strongest.},

   abstract = {Abstract. As ocean general circulation models (OGCMs) move into the petascale age, where the output of single simulations exceeds petabytes of storage space, tools to analyse the output of these models will need to scale up too. Lagrangian ocean analysis, where virtual particles are tracked through hydrodynamic fields, is an increasingly popular way to analyse OGCM output, by mapping pathways and connectivity of biotic and abiotic particulates. However, the current software stack of Lagrangian ocean analysis codes is not dynamic enough to cope with the increasing complexity, scale and need for customization of use-cases. Furthermore, most community codes are developed for stand-alone use, making it a nontrivial task to integrate virtual particles at runtime of the OGCM. Here, we introduce the new Parcels code, which was designed from the ground up to be sufficiently scalable to cope with petascale computing. We highlight its API design that combines flexibility and customization with the ability to optimize for HPC workflows, following the paradigm of domain-specific languages. Parcels is primarily written in Python, utilizing the wide range of tools available in the scientific Python ecosystem, while generating low-level C code and using just-in-time compilation for performance-critical computation. We show a worked-out example of its API, and validate the accuracy of the code against seven idealized test cases. This version 0.9 of Parcels is focused on laying out the API, with future work concentrating on support for curvilinear grids, optimization, efficiency and at-runtime coupling with OGCMs.},

   abstract = {AbstractBesides the zonal flow that dominates the seasonal and long-term variability in the equatorial Atlantic, energetic intraseasonal meridional velocity fluctuations are observed in large parts of the water column. We use 15 years of partly full-depth velocity data from an equatorial mooring at 23°W to investigate intraseasonal variability and specifically the downward propagation of intraseasonal energy from the near-surface into the deep ocean. Between 20 and 50 m, intraseasonal variability at 23°W peaks at periods between 30 and 40 days. It is associated with westward-propagating tropical instability waves, which undergo an annual intensification in August. At deeper levels down to about 2000 m considerable intraseasonal energy is still observed. A frequency–vertical mode decomposition reveals that meridional velocity fluctuations are more energetic than the zonal ones for periods < 50 days. The energy peak at 30–40 days and at vertical modes 2–5 excludes equatorial Rossby waves and suggests Yanai waves to be associated with the observed intraseasonal energy. Yanai waves that are considered to be generated by tropical instability waves propagate their energy from the near-surface west of 23°W downward and eastward to eventually reach the mooring location. The distribution of intraseasonal energy at the mooring position depends largely on the dominant frequency and the time, depth, and longitude of excitation, while the dominant vertical mode of the Yanai waves plays only a minor role. Observations also show the presence of weaker intraseasonal variability at 23°W below 2000 m that cannot be associated with tropical instability waves.},

   abstract = {Rapid intensification (RI) of hurricanes is notoriously difficult to predict and can contribute to severe destruction and loss of life. While past studies examined the frequency of RI occurrence, changes in RI magnitude were not considered. Here we explore changes in RI magnitude over the 30-year satellite period of 1986–2015. In the central and eastern tropical Atlantic, which includes much of the main development region, the 95th percentile of 24-hr intensity changes increased at 3.8 knots per decade. In the western tropical Atlantic, encompassing the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, trends are insignificant. Our analysis reveals that warming of the upper ocean coinciding with the positive phase of Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, and associated changes in the large-scale environment, has predominantly favored RI magnitude increases in the central and eastern tropical Atlantic. These results have substantial implications for the eastern Caribbean Islands, some of which were devastated during the 2017 hurricane season. Plain Language Summary In this study, using an analysis of observations and climate model output, we demonstrate that the magnitude of rapid intensification (RI), defined as an event where a hurricane increases in intensity by 25 knots or higher in 24 hr, increased in the central and eastern tropical Atlantic during the 30-year satellite period of 1986–2015. On the other hand, in the western tropical Atlantic, changes in RI magnitude are insignificant. Conspiring changes in the large-scale hurricane environment brought about by a positive shift in the phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, the dominant mode of decadal climate variability in the Atlantic, are primarily responsible for these changes in RI. While previous studies examined the frequency of RI, our study is the first to understand potential changes in RI magnitude. The results from our study have substantial implications for the eastern Caribbean Islands, some of which were ravaged by several major hurricanes undergoing RI during the recently concluded 2017 Atlantic hurricane season.},

   abstract = {Comparing the high-quality oxygen climatology from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment to earlier data we reveal near-global decreases in oxygen levels in the upper ocean between the 1970s and the 1990s. This globally averaged oxygen decrease is &#8722;0.93 � 0.23 &#956;mol l&#8722;1, which is equivalent to annual oxygen losses of &#8722;0.55 � 0.13 � 1014 mol yr&#8722;1 (100&#8211;1000 m). The strongest decreases in oxygen occur in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, near regions where there is strong water renewal and exchange between the ocean interior and surface waters. Approximately 15% of global oxygen decrease can be explained by a warmer mixed-layer reducing the capacity of water to store oxygen, while the remainder is consistent with an overall decrease in the exchange between surface waters and the ocean interior. Here we suggest that this reduction in water mass renewal rates on a global scale is a consequence of increased stratification caused by warmer surface waters. These observations support climate model simulations of oxygen change under global warming scenarios.},

   abstract = {Historic observations of dissolved oxygen (O-2) in the ocean are analyzed to quantify multidecadal trends and variability from 1958 to 2015. Additional quality control is applied, and the resultant oxygen anomaly field is used to quantify upper ocean O-2 trends at global and hemispheric scales. A widespread negative O-2 trend is beginning to emerge from the envelope of interannual variability. Ocean reanalysis data are used to evaluate relationships with changes in ocean heat content (OHC) and oxygen solubility (O-2,O-sat). Global O-2 decline is evident after the 1980s, accompanied by an increase in global OHC. The global upper ocean O-2 inventory (0-1000m) changed at the rate of -243124TmolO(2) per decade. Further, the O-2 inventory is negatively correlated with the OHC (r=-0.86; 0-1000m) and the regression coefficient of O-2 to OHC is approximately -8.20.66nmolO(2)J(-1), on the same order of magnitude as the simulated O-2-heat relationship typically found in ocean climate models. Variability and trends in the observed upper ocean O-2 concentration are dominated by the apparent oxygen utilization component with relatively small contributions from O-2,O-sat. This indicates that changing ocean circulation, mixing, and/or biochemical processes, rather than the direct thermally induced solubility effects, are the primary drivers for the observed O-2 changes. The spatial patterns of the multidecadal trend include regions of enhanced ocean deoxygenation including the subpolar North Pacific, eastern boundary upwelling systems, and tropical oxygen minimum zones. Further studies are warranted to understand and attribute the global O-2 trends and their regional expressions. Plain Language Summary This new paper describes the analysis of the dissolved oxygen in the global ocean using the most recent version of the World Ocean Database for the period of 1955 to 2015. After careful examination of the data, we found that a statistically significant, widespread O-2 decline is emerging beyond the envelope of natural fluctuations. Our study also reveals a tight relationship between O-2 inventories and the ocean heat content. The spatial pattern and magnitude of this relationship are consistent with expectations derived from mechanistic ocean climate models forced under climate warming scenarios. Taken together, the trends we document here are suggestive of the effects of the ocean warming beginning to supersede natural variability and emerge as a recognizable signal. This merits additional scrutiny over the coming years.},

   abstract = {Marine sediments from the North Pacific document two episodes of expansion and strengthening of the subsurface oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) accompanied by seafloor hypoxia during the last deglacial transition1–4. The mechanisms driving this hypoxia remain under debate1–11. We present a new high-resolution alkenone palaeotemperature reconstruction from the Gulf of Alaska that reveals two abrupt warming events of 4–5 degrees Celsius at the onset of the Bølling and Holocene intervals that coincide with sudden shifts to hypoxia at intermediate depths. The presence of diatomaceous laminations and hypoxia-tolerant benthic foraminiferal species, peaks in redox-sensitive trace metals12,13, and enhanced 15N/14N ratio of organic matter13, collectively suggest association with high export production. A decrease in 18O/16O values of benthic foraminifera accompanying the most severe deoxygenation event indicates subsurface warming of up to about 2 degrees Celsius. We infer that abrupt warming triggered expansion of the North Pacific OMZ through reduced oxygen solubility and increased marine productivity via physiological effects; following initiation of hypoxia, remobilization of iron from hypoxic sediments could have provided a positive feedback on ocean deoxygenation through increased nutrient utilization and carbon export. Such a biogeochemical amplification process implies high sensitivity of OMZ expansion to warming.},

   abstract = {Ocean ecosystems are increasingly stressed by human-induced changes of their phys- ical, chemical and biological environment. Among these changes, warming, acidifica- tion, deoxygenation and changes in primary productivity by marine phytoplankton can 5 be considered as four of the major stressors of open ocean ecosystems. Due to ris- ing atmospheric CO2 in the coming decades, these changes will be amplified. Here, we use the most recent simulations performed in the framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 to assess how these stressors may evolve over the course of the 21st century. The 10 Earth System Models used here project similar trends 10 in ocean warming, acidification, deoxygenation and reduced primary productivity for each of the IPCC’s representative concentration parthways (RCP) over the 21st cen- tury. For the “business-as-usual” scenario RCP8.5, the model-mean changes in 2090s (compared to 1990s) for sea surface temperature, sea surface pH, global O2 content and integrated primary productivity amount to +2.73 ◦C, −0.33 pH unit, −3.45% and 15 −8.6%, respectively. For the high mitigation scenario RCP2.6, corresponding changes are +0.71 ◦C, −0.07 pH unit, −1.81% and −2.0% respectively, illustrating the effec- tiveness of extreme mitigation strategies. Although these stressors operate globally, they display distinct regional patterns. Large decreases in O2 and in pH are simulated in global ocean intermediate and mode waters, whereas large reductions in primary 20 production are simulated in the tropics and in the North Atlantic. Although temperature and pH projections are robust across models, the same does not hold for projections of sub-surface O2 concentrations in the tropics and global and regional changes in net primary},

   abstract = {In the modern ocean, oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are potential traces of a primitive ocean in which Archean bacteria lived and reduced chemical anomalies occurred. But OMZs are also keys to understanding the present unbalanced nitrogen cycle and the oceans' role on atmospheric greenhouse control. OMZs are the main areas of nitrogen loss (as N2, N2O) to the atmosphere through denitrification and anammox, and could even indirectly mitigate the oceanic biological sequestration of CO2. It was recently hypothesized that OMZs are going to spread in the coming decades as a consequence of global climate change. Despite an important OMZ role for the origin of marine life and for the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen, there are some key questions on the structure of OMZs at a global scale. There is no agreement concerning the threshold in oxygen that defines an OMZ, and the extent of an OMZ is often evaluated by denitrification criteria which, at the same time, are O2-dependent. Our work deals with the identification of each OMZ, the evaluation of its extent, volume and vertical structure, the determination of its seasonality or permanence and the comparison between OMZs and denitrification zones at a global scale. The co-existence in the OMZ of oxic (in its boundaries) and suboxic (even anoxic, in its core) conditions involves rather complex biogeochemical processes such as strong remineralization of the organic matter, removal of nitrate and release of nitrite. The quantitative OMZ analysis is focused on taking into account the whole water volume under the influence of an OMZ and adapted to the study of the specific low oxygen biogeochemical processes. A characterization of the entire structure for the main and most intense OMZs (O2< 20 μM reaching 1 μM in the core) is proposed based on a previously published CRIO criterion from the eastern South Pacific OMZ and including a large range of O2concentrations. Using the updated global WOA2005 O2climatology, the four known tropical OMZs in the open ocean have been described: the Eastern South Pacific and Eastern Tropical North Pacific, in the Pacific Ocean; the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, in the Indian Ocean. Moreover, the Eastern Sub-Tropical North Pacific (25-52°N) has been identified as a lesser known permanent deep OMZ. Two additional seasonal OMZs at high latitude have also been identified: the West Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. The total surface of the permanent OMZs is 30.4 millions of km2(∼8% of the total oceanic area), and the volume of the OMZ cores (10.3 millions of km3) corresponds to a value ∼7 times higher than previous evaluations. The volume of the OMZ cores is about three times larger than that of the associated denitrification zone, here defined as NMZ ('nitrate deficit or NDEF > 10 μM' maximum zone). The larger OMZ, relative to the extent of denitrification zone, suggests that the unbalanced nitrogen cycle on the global scale could be more intense than previously recognized and that evaluation of the OMZ from denitrification could underestimate their extent. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) is characterized by the sea surface warming (cooling) of the entire North Atlantic during its warm (cold) phase. Both observations and most of the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models also show that the warm (cold) phase of the AMO is as- sociated with a surface warming (cooling) and a subsurface cooling (warming) in the tropical North Atlantic (TNA). It is further shown that the warm phase of the AMOcorresponds to a strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and a weakening of the Atlantic subtropical cell (STC), which both induce an anomalous northward current in the TNA subsurface ocean. Because the mean meridional temperature gradient of the subsurface ocean is positive because of the temperature dome around 98N, the advection by the anomalous northward current cools theTNAsubsurface ocean during the warm phase of the AMO. The opposite is true during the cold phase of the AMO. It is concluded that the anticorrelated ocean temperature variation in the TNA associated with the AMO is caused by the meridional current variation induced by variability of the AMOC and STC, but the AMOC plays a more important role than the STC. Observations do not seem to show an obvious anticorrelated salinity relation between the TNA surface and subsurface oceans, but most of CMIP5 models simulate an out-of-phase salinity variation. Similar to the temperature variation, the mechanism is the salinity advection by the meridional current variation induced by the AMOC and STC associated with the AMO.},

The TIWs appear as periodic 20-30 day fluctuations of currents, temperature, and salinity, which intensify beginning in June and peak in late boreal summer. The intensification occurs in phase with strengthening of the southeasterly trade winds and the seasonal appearance of the equatorial tongue of cold mixed layer temperatures. In 2002 these waves, which warm the mixed layer by 0.35°C during summer months, are maintained by both barotropic and baroclinic conversions that are of comparable size. Salinity fluctuations, previously neglected, increase the magnitude of baroclinic energy conversion. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {The North Equatorial Undercurrent (NEUC) has been suggested to act as an important oxygen supply route towards the oxygen minimum zone in the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic. Observational estimates of the mean NEUC strength are uncertain due to the presence of elevated mesoscale activities, and models have difficulties in simulating a realistic NEUC. Here we investigate the interannual variability of the NEUC and its impact onto oxygen based on the output of a high‐resolution ocean general circulation model (OGCM) and contrast the results with an unique data set of 21 ship sections along 23° W and a conceptual model. We find that the interannual variability of the NEUC in the OGCM is related to the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) with a stronger and more northward NEUC during negative AMM phases. Discrepancies between OGCM and observations suggest a different role of the NEUC in setting the regional oxygen distribution. In the model a stronger NEUC is associated with a weaker oxygen supply towards the east. We attribute this to a too strong recirculation between the NEUC and the northern branch of the South Equatorial Current (nSEC) in the OGCM. Idealized experiments with the conceptual model support the idea that the impact of NEUC variability on oxygen depends on the source water pathway. A strengthening of the NEUC supplied out of the western boundary acts to increase oxygen levels within the NEUC. A strengthening of the recirculations between NEUC and the nSEC results in a reduction of oxygen levels within the NEUC.},

The first 21-month record reveals a highly variable overturning circulation responsible for the majority of the heat and freshwater transport across the OSNAP line. In a departure from the prevailing view that changes in deep water formation in the Labrador Sea dominate MOC variability, these results suggest that the conversion of warm, salty, shallow Atlantic waters into colder, fresher, deep waters that move southward in the Irminger and Iceland basins is largely responsible for overturning and its variability in the subpolar basin.},

The classical case of favorable winds driving coastal upwelling does not adequately account for the upwelling observed along the northwestern Gulf of Guinea (GoG) coast, which is the area of focus in this letter. Herein, we used mainly satellite-derived data to examine the dynamics of upwelling in the study area. Upwelling indexes are derived from sea surface temperature (SST) and wind influences. Low SST, which is a characteristic of upwelling, is observed mainly along the entire coastal region from July to September. The relative contributions of local wind forcing are quantified; the wind-stress-driven Ekman transport was more important than the wind-stress-curl-driven Ekman pumping in affecting changes in SST. They both however do not entirely explain the upwelling that is observed along the entire coast. It is shown that winds in the western equatorial Atlantic force eastward propagating upwelling Kelvin waves that lead to lowering of sea level and SST along the northwestern GoG coast.},

On deeper isopycnals, there are regions where Q contours deviate from latitude circles and even regions of nearly uniform Q. These different regimes appear to be robust features over the interior of ocean basins, as the standard error is found to be relatively small there. The nearly uniform Q occurs in the deep waters of the North Pacific and, possibly, in the bottom waters of the western North Atlantic and North Pacific. The nearly uniform Q has a low magnitude in each case, as well as a relatively low variability for the deep waters of the North Pacific. This nearly uniform Q signal appears to be formed when a single water mass enters the basin from a low latitude source.},

Previous delineations of hypoxic environments focus on those in enclosed seas where hypoxia may be exacerbated by anthropogenically induced eutrophication. Permanently hypoxic water masses in the open ocean, referred to as oxygen minimum zones, impinge on a much larger seafloor surface area along continental margins of the eastern Pacific, Indian and western Atlantic Oceans. We provide the first global quantification of naturally hypoxic continental margin floor by determining upper and lower oxygen minimum zone depth boundaries from hydrographic data and computing the area between the isobaths using seafloor topography. This approach reveals that there are over one million km2 of permanently hypoxic shelf and bathyal sea floor, where dissolved oxygen is <0.5mll-1; over half (59%) occurs in the northern Indian Ocean. We also document strong variation in the intensity, vertical position and thickness of the OMZ as a function of latitude in the eastern Pacific Ocean and as a function of longitude in the northern Indian Ocean. Seafloor OMZs are regions of low biodiversity and are inhospitable to most commercially valuable marine resources, but support a fascinating array of protozoan and metazoan adaptations to hypoxic conditions. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

As previously shown, Doppler shifting of long Rossby waves is determined by the projection of the mean currents onto the wave's squared zonal-velocity and pressure fields. PV-gradient modification matters only to the extent that it projects onto the wave field's squared meridional velocity. Because the zeros of an equatorial wave's meridional velocity are staggered relative to those of the zonal velocity and pressure, and because the meridional scales of the equatorial currents are similar to those of the low-mode Rossby waves, different parts of the current system dominate the advective and PV-gradient modification effects on a single mode. Since the equatorial symmetry of classical equatorial waves alternates between symmetric and antisymmetric with increasing meridional mode number, the currents produce opposite effects on adjacent modes. Meridional mode 1 is slowed primarily by a combination of eastward advection by the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) and the PV-gradient decrease at the peaks of the South Equatorial Current (SEC). The mode-2 phase speed, in contrast, is increased primarily by a combination of westward advection by the SEC and the PV-gradient increase at the core of the EUC. Perturbation solutions are carried to second order in ε, the Rossby number of the mean current, and it is shown that this is necessary to capture the full effect of quasi-realistic current systems, which are asymmetric about the equator. Equatorially symmetric components of the current system affect the phase speed at O(ε2), but antisymmetric components of the currents and distortions of the wave structures by the currents do not influence the phase speed until O(ε2). © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Abstract In the equatorial Atlantic the sea surface height (SSH) anomaly field is dominated by an annual signal propagating eastward. This signal has been previously interpreted in terms of propagating waves. In this article it is argued that this propagating signal is not a free equatorial Kelvin wave because the phase velocity observed is too small compared to first, second, or third baroclinic mode Kelvin waves, and is not the result of an equatorial forced wave because the zonal wind stress does not show a similar propagation. Rather, it is suggested that the eastward propagation in SSH is due to the sum of two independent modes of variability: one mainly driven by the wind stress curl off the equator, and the other driven by the zonal wind stress along the equator. These two modes are uncorrelated in time and space and therefore can be conveniently separated by an empirical orthogonal function analysis of the equatorial Atlantic sea surface height. The first mode explains 74% of the variance, is one-...},

Second, does the intrinsic variability in these basins matter for ENSO predictability? These questions are addressed by assessing the existence and strength of the Bjerknes and delayed negative feedbacks in each tropical basin, and by fitting conceptual recharge oscillator models, both with and without interactions among the basins. In the equatorial Atlantic the Bjerknes and delayed negative feedbacks exist, although weaker than in the Pacific. Equatorial Atlantic variability is well described by the recharge oscillator model, with an oscillatory mixed ocean dynamics–sea surface temperature (SST) mode present in boreal spring and summer. The dynamics of the tropical Indian Ocean, however, appear to be quite different: no recharge–discharge mechanism is found. Although a positive Bjerknes-like feedback from July to September is found, the role of heat content seems secondary. Results also show that Indian Ocean interaction with ENSO tends to damp the ENSO oscillation and is responsible for a frequency shift to shorter periods. However, the retrospective forecast skill of the conceptual model is hardly improved by explicitly including Indian Ocean SST. The interaction between ENSO and the equatorial Atlantic variability is weaker. However, a feedback from the Atlantic on ENSO appears to exist, which slightly improves the retrospective forecast skill of the conceptual model.},

Many prominent examples of regional multidecadal climate variability have been related to the AMO, such as North Eastern Brazilian and African Sahel rainfall, Atlantic hurricanes and North American and European summer climate. The relative shortness of the instrumental climate record, however, limits confidence in these observationally derived relationships. Here, we seek evidence of these links in the 1400 year control simulation of the HadCM3 climate model, which produces a realistic long-lived AMO as part of its internal climate variability. By permitting the analysis of more AMO cycles than are present in observations, we find that the model confirms the association of the AMO with almost all of the above phenomena. This has implications for the predictability of regional climate.},

   abstract = {Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) is investigated in a millennial control simulation with the Kiel Climate Model (KCM), a coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice model. An oscillatory mode with approximately 60 years period and characteristics similar to observations is identified with the aid of three-dimensional temperature and salinity joint empirical orthogonal function analysis. The mode explains 30 % of variability on centennial and shorter timescales in the upper 2,000 m of the North Atlantic. It is associated with changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) of ±1-2 Sv and Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of ±0.2 °C. AMV in KCM results from an out-of-phase interaction between horizontal and vertical ocean circulation, coupled through Irminger Sea convection. Wintertime convection in this region is mainly controlled by salinity anomalies transported by the Subpolar Gyre (SPG). Increased (decreased) dense water formation in this region leads to a stronger (weaker) AMOC after 15 years, and this in turn leads to a weaker (stronger) SPG after another 15 years. The key role of salinity variations in the subpolar North Atlantic for AMV is confirmed in a 1,000 year long simulation with salinity restored to model climatology: No low frequency variations in convection are simulated, and the 60 year mode of variability is absent. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {Systematic climate shifts have been linked to multidecadal variability in observed sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean. These links are extensive, influencing a range of climate processes such as hurricane activity and African Sahel and Amazonian droughts. The variability is distinct from historical global-mean temperature changes and is commonly attributed to natural ocean oscillations. A number of studies have provided evidence that aerosols can influence long-term changes in sea surface temperatures, but climate models have so far failed to reproduce these interactions and the role of aerosols in decadal variability remains unclear. Here we use a state-of-the-art Earth system climate model to show that aerosol emissions and periods of volcanic activity explain 76 per cent of the simulated multidecadal variance in detrended 1860-2005 North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. After 1950, simulated variability is within observational estimates; our estimates for 1910-1940 capture twice the warming of previous generation models but do not explain the entire observed trend. Other processes, such as ocean circulation, may also have contributed to variability in the early twentieth century. Mechanistically, we find that inclusion of aerosol-cloud microphysical effects, which were included in few previous multimodel ensembles, dominates the magnitude (80 per cent) and the spatial pattern of the total surface aerosol forcing in the North Atlantic. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic aerosol emissions influenced a range of societally important historical climate events such as peaks in hurricane activity and Sahel drought. Decadal-scale model predictions of regional Atlantic climate will probably be improved by incorporating aerosol-cloud microphysical interactions and estimates of future concentrations of aerosols, emissions of which are directly addressable by policy actions. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

   abstract = {This is a review about the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), its mean structure, temporal variability, controlling mechanisms, and role in the coupled climate system. The AMOC plays a central role in climate through its heat and freshwater transports. Northward ocean heat transport achieved by the AMOC is responsible for the relative warmth of the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere and is thought to play a role in setting the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone north of the equator. The AMOCis a key means by which heat anomalies are sequestered into the ocean’s interior and thus modulates the trajectory of climate change. Fluctuations in the AMOC have been linked to low-frequency variability of Atlantic sea surface temperatures with a host of implications for climate variability over surrounding landmasses. On intra-annual timescales, variability in AMOC is large and primarily reflects the response to local wind forcing; meridional coherence of anomalies is limited to that of the wind field. On interannual to decadal timescales, AMOC changes are primarily geostrophic and related to buoyancy anomalies on the western boundary. A pacemaker region for decadal AMOC changes is located in a western “transition zone” along the boundary between the subtropical and subpolar gyres. Decadal AMOC anomalies are communicated meridionally from this region. AMOC observations, aswell as the expanded ocean observational network provided by the Argo array and satellite altimetry, are inspiring efforts to develop decadal predictability systems using coupled atmosphere-ocean models initialized by ocean data.},

   abstract = {The causes and characteristics of interannual to decadal variability of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the North Atlantic are investigated with a suite of basin-scale ocean models (FLAME) and global ocean-ice models (ORCA) varying in resolution from medium- to eddy-resolving (1/2° – 1/12°), using various forcing configurations built on bulk formulations invoking atmospheric reanalysis products. Comparison of the model hindcasts indicates similar MOC variability characteristics on time scales up to a decade; both model architectures also simulate an upward trend in MOC strength between the early 1970s and mid-1990s. The causes of the MOC changes are examined by perturbation experiments aimed selectively at the response to individual forcing components. The solutions emphasize an inherently linear character of the mid-latitude MOC variability by demonstrating that the anomalies of a (non eddy-resolving) hind-cast simulation can be understood as a superposition of decadal and longer-term signals originating from thermohaline forcing variability, and a higher-frequency wind-driven variability. The thermohaline MOC signal is linked to the variability in subarctic deep water formation, and rapidly progressing to the tropical Atlantic. However, throughout the subtropical and mid-latitude North Atlantic this signal is effectively masked by stronger MOC variability related to wind forcing and, especially north of 30–35° N, by internally-induced (eddy) fluctuations.},

Observations over the past decade have changed that situation, providing a detailed picture of variations in the AMOC. These observations reveal a surprising degree of AMOC variability in terms of the intraannual range, the amplitude and phase of the seasonal cycle, the interannual changes in strength affecting the ocean heat content, and the decline of the AMOC over the decade, both of the latter two exceeding the variations seen in climate models.},

   abstract = {A fully three-dimensional primitive equation simulation is performed to “reunite” the local equatorial dynamics of the subsurface countercurrents (SCCs) and thermostad with the large-scale tropical ventilated ocean dynamics. It captures (i) the main characteristics of the equatorial thermostad, the SCCs' location and their eastward evolution, and the potential vorticity budget with its equatorial homogenization to zero values and (ii) the large-scale meridional shoaling of the thermocline equatorward. It supports the idea that the two-dimensional Hadley cell mechanism proposed by Marin et al. is a candidate able to operate in a fully three-dimensional ocean. The main difference between the 2D Hadley cell mechanism and the oceanic 3D case is that for the 3D case the large-scale meridional velocity at zeroth order is geostrophic, while the cell mechanism is a next-order, small-scale mechanism. A detailed budget of the zonal momentum equation is provided for the ageostrophic dynamics at work in the SCCs. The mean meridional advection and the Coriolis term dominate, discounting the possibility that lateral eddies play a major role for the SCCs' creation. A 3½-layer idealized ventilation model, calibrated to the three-dimensional simulation parameters, is able not only to capture the tropical density structure, but also to isolate the main controlling factors leading to the triggering of the equatorial secondary cells with its associated jet and thermostad, namely, the shoaling of the equatorial thermocline because of low potential vorticity injection at distant subduction latitudes. It is also shown that equatorial recirculation gyres play a quantitative role that may be of the same order of magnitude as ventilation from higher latitudes.},

   abstract = {Sensitivity tests are performed to assess the respective influences of the large-scale ventilation and of the near-equatorial winds on the dynamics of the the subsurface countercurrents (SCCs) and thermostad. They show that the intensity of the inertial jets is a function of the potential vorticity (PV) values at subduction and that stronger jets are favored by low PV injection, forced in the authors’ framework either by a deep mixed layer at subduction and/or by an injection of PV at lower latitudes. Such circumstances lead to a strong meridional shoaling of the thermocline near the equator. The resulting inertial jets occur at about 3?N in the western part of the basin and are the poleward limit of a near-0 PV region and of an equatorial thermostad. A necessary condition for the existence of inertial jets is that the equatorial wind fetch is large enough, otherwise only weak time-mean eastward currents are produced by a nonlinear rectification of instability waves farther away from the equator. The presence of a North Equatorial Countercurrent does not constitute a barrier for equatorward motions within the lower thermocline, and inertial jets are still controlled by the meridional slope of the SSCs’ layer setup through the establishment of tropical PV pools predicted by ventilation theory.},

   abstract = {The Tsuchiya jets. or subsurface countercurrents, extend across the Pacific Ocean carrying 7 (+/-2) x 10(6) m(3) s(-1) eastward on each side of the equator. Mean meridional sections of potential temperature, salinity, neutral density anomaly, and the square of buoyancy frequency are presented for the western. central, and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. These sections are used together with maps of depth and salinity on isopycnals, as well as thickness between isopycnals, to describe the evolution of the Tsuchiya jets as they flow from west to east. An inertial-jet model is formulated in which conservation of the Bernoulli function and potential vorticity combine with the eastward shoaling of the tropical pycnocline to dictate the jet structure. This model jet is consistent with a number of features of the Tsuchiya jets: their roughly constant volume transports. their advection of properties such as salinity and oxygen over long zonal distances. their rapidity and narrowness, their poleward shift from west to east, the large potential vorticity gradients across them, and the pycnostad between them that builds in size and strength from west to east. However. an observed decrease in density carried by the Tsuchiya jets from west to east, not included in the model jet, suggests that diffusive or advective interaction with the surrounding ocean also may be important in subsurface countercurrent dynamics.},

   abstract = {Ocean oxygenation has been observed to have changed over the past few decades and is projected to change further under global climate change due to an interplay of several mechanisms. In this study we isolate the effect of modified tropical surface wind stress conditions on the evolution of ocean oxygenation in a numerical climate model. We find that ocean oxygenation varies inversely with low-latitude surface wind stress. Approximately one third of this response is driven by sea surface temperature anomalies; the remaining two thirds result from changes in ocean circulation and marine biology. Global mean O2 concentration changes reach maximum values of +4 μM and -3.6 μM in the two most extreme perturbation cases of -30% and +30% wind change, respectively. Localized changes lie between +92 μM under 30% reduced winds and -56 μM for 30% increased winds. Overall, we find that the extent of the global low-oxygen volume varies with the same sign as the wind perturbation; namely, weaker winds reduce the low-oxygen volume on the global scale and vice versa for increased trade winds. We identify two regions, one in the Pacific Ocean off Chile and the other in the Indian Ocean off Somalia, that are of particular importance for the evolution of oxygen minimum zones in the global ocean.},

   abstract = {The seasonal regime associated with the eastern part of the cyclonic tropical gyre in the North Atlantic is studied using a high-resolution model. The model reproduces a vertical water mass transition (between South and North Atlantic Central Water) previously observed near σ0=26.8, which approximately coincides with the base of the North Equatorial Undercurrent (NEUC). The same density may be taken as the lower limit of the large-scale cyclonic flow. The gyre southern flank is formed of the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) in the near-surface layer, and of the NEUC and deep NECC (when this current is developed) in the Central Water. Its poleward limb is made up from the Ekman drift of the trade winds, a northeastward extension of the NEUC/deep NECC, and reinforced by an extension of the Guinea undercurrent along the African continental slope. Model experiments with two different wind forcings were carried out to estimate the transports across 12°N, an approximate gyre central latitude. The time-averaged transport for densities lower than σ1=32.3 and to the east of 35°W is around 4 Sv northward, about one-third of the basin-wide net value which measures the Meridional Overturning Circulation. The near-surface layer accounts for about 3 Sv, and the Central Water for more than 1 Sv, in keeping with the presence of South Atlantic Central Water in the tropical eastern basin. The eastern basin near-surface flow is lowest in summer, when the trade winds nearly vanish at this latitude. In this season the NECC, though having entered its phase of intensification, leaves the region of positive wind stress curl, and temporarily does not act as the tropical gyre southern limb. At the subsurface, most of the NEUC folds up westward at ∼10°N in winter, thus forming an inner circulation of the basin-wide gyre, previously reported from observations. The cyclonic flow associated with the Guinea Dome is another inner circulation, which the model found to be permanent below the surface down to 400-500 m, but masked in the Ekman layer, except in summer. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We observed that in the meridional Ekman heat and salt flux calculation, using only the sea surface temperature and salinity data had a negligible impact on the resulting fluxes compared to using temperature and salinity profile data covering the Ekman layer.

Here we present high-resolution surface measurements and vertical profiles of nitrous oxide that include the highest reported nitrous oxide concentrations in marine surface waters, suggesting that there is a hotspot of nitrous oxide emissions in high-productivity upwelling ecosystems along the Peruvian coast. We estimate that off Peru, the extremely high nitrous oxide supersaturations we observed drive a massive efflux of 0.2-0.9 Tg of nitrogen emitted as nitrous oxide per year, equivalent to 5-22% of previous estimates of global marine nitrous oxide emissions. Nutrient and gene abundance data suggest that coupled nitrification-denitrification in the upper oxygen minimum zone and transport of resulting nitrous oxide to the surface by upwelling lead to the high nitrous oxide concentrations. Our estimate of nitrous oxide emissions from the Peruvian coast surpasses values from similar, highly productive areas.},

   abstract = {Abstract. Sea-to-air and diapycnal fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) into the mixed layer were determined during three cruises to the upwelling region off Mauritania. Sea-to-air fluxes as well as diapycnal fluxes were elevated close to the shelf break, but elevated sea-to-air fluxes reached further offshore as a result of the offshore transport of upwelled water masses. To calculate a mixed layer budget for N2O we compared the regionally averaged sea-to-air and diapycnal fluxes and estimated the potential contribution of other processes, such as vertical advection and biological N2O production in the mixed layer. Using common parameterizations for the gas transfer velocity, the comparison of the average sea-to-air and diapycnal N2O fluxes indicated that the mean sea-to-air flux is about three to four times larger than the diapycnal flux. Neither vertical and horizontal advection nor biological production were found sufficient to close the mixed layer budget. Instead, the sea-to-air flux, calculated using a parameterization that takes into account the attenuating effect of surfactants on gas exchange, is in the same range as the diapycnal flux. From our observations we conclude that common parameterizations for the gas transfer velocity likely overestimate the air-sea gas exchange within highly productive upwelling zones.},

where oceanic conditions due to the presence of coastal upwelling may
influence the regional climate and fisheries. The dynamics of this
coastal upwelling is still poorly understood. A sensitivity experiment
based on the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) is carried out to
assess the role of the detachment of the Guinea Current as a potential
mechanism for coastal upwelling. This idealized experiment is performed
by canceling the inertia terms responsible for the advection of momentum
in the equations and comparing with a realistic experiment. The results
exhibit two major differences. First, the Guinea Current is found to be
highly sensitive to inertia, as it is no longer detached from the coast
in the idealized experiment. The Guinea Current adjusts on an inertial
boundary layer, the inertial terms defining its lateral extension.
Second, the upwelling east of Cape Palmas disappears in absence of the
Guinea Current detachment. This is in contrast with the upwelling east
of Cape Three Points, which is still present. The results suggest that
two different generation processes of the coastal upwelling need to be
considered: the upwelling east of Cape Palmas (which is due to inertia,
topographic variations, and advective terms effects resulting in
important vertical pumping) and the upwelling east of Cape Three Points
(which is principally induced by local winds). In addition to recent
work ruling out the role of eddies, this study clarifies the processes
responsible for this coastal upwelling.},

Although ocean warming contributions to oxygen declines through a reduction in oxygen solubility and stratification effects on ventilation are reasonably well understood, it has been a major challenge to identify drivers and modifying factors that explain different regional patterns, especially in the tropical oceans.

Yet, the extent at which near-surface waters emit N2O to the atmosphere in the BUS is highly uncertain. Here we present the first high-resolution surface measurements of N2O across the northern part of the BUS (nBUS).We found strong gradients with a threefold increase in N2O concentrations near the coast as compared with open ocean waters. Our observations show enhanced sea-to-air fluxes of N2O (up to 1.67 nmol m−2 s−1) in association with local upwelling cells. Based on our data we suggest that the nBUS can account for 13% of the total coastal upwelling source of N2O to the atmosphere.},

   abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Observations indicate an expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) over the past 50 years, likely related to ongoing deoxygenation caused by reduced oxygen solubility, changes in stratification and circulation, and a potential acceleration of organic matter turnover in a warming climate. The overall area of ocean sediments that are in direct contact with low-oxygen bottom waters also increases with expanding OMZs. This leads to a release of phosphorus from ocean sediments. If anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions continue unabated, higher temperatures will cause enhanced weathering on land, which, in turn, will increase the phosphorus and alkalinity fluxes into the ocean and therefore raise the ocean's phosphorus inventory even further. A higher availability of phosphorus enhances biological production, remineralisation and oxygen consumption, and might therefore lead to further expansions of OMZs, representing a positive feedback. A negative feedback arises from the enhanced productivity-induced drawdown of carbon and also increased uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> due to weathering-induced alkalinity input. This feedback leads to a decrease in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and weathering rates. Here, we quantify these two competing feedbacks on millennial timescales for a high CO<sub>2</sub> emission scenario. Using the University of Victoria (UVic) Earth System Climate Model of intermediate complexity, our model results suggest that the positive benthic phosphorus release feedback has only a minor impact on the size of OMZs in the next 1000 years. The increase in the marine phosphorus inventory under assumed business-as-usual global warming conditions originates, on millennial timescales, almost exclusively (&amp;gt;<span class="thinspace"></span>80<span class="thinspace"></span>%) from the input via terrestrial weathering and causes a 4- to 5-fold expansion of the suboxic water volume in the model.</p>},

Here we analyze long-term moored velocity and oxygen observations, as well as shipboard hydrographic and current sections acquired along 23W and covering the depth range of the oxygen minimum zones of the eastern tropical North and South Atlantic. The moored zonal velocity data show high-baroclinic mode EDJ oscillations at a period of about 4.5 years. Equatorial oxygen observations which do not resolve or cover a full 4.5-yr EDJ cycle nevertheless reveal large variability, with oxygen concentrations locally spanning a range of more than 60 mol kg-1. We study the effect of EDJs on the equatorial oxygen concentration by forcing an advection-diffusion model with the velocity field of the gravest equatorial basin mode corresponding to the observed EDJ cycle. The advection-diffusion model includes an oxygen source at the western boundary and oxygen consumption elsewhere. The model produces a 4.5-yr cycle of the oxygen concentration and a temporal phase difference between oxygen concentration and eastward velocity that is less than quadrature, implying a net eastward oxygen flux. The comparison of available observations and basin-mode simulations indicates that a substantial part of the observed oxygen variability at the equator can be explained by EDJ oscillations. The respective role of mean advection, EDJs, and other possible processes in shaping the mean oxygen distribution of the equatorial Atlantic at intermediate depth is discussed. © 2012.

The drought was linked to suppression of the South Atlantic convergence zone and its associated rainfall, which led to water shortages in Brazil and impacted food supplies globally. Here we show from observations that such droughts and adjacent marine heatwaves have a common remote cause. Atmospheric blocking triggered by tropical convection in the Indian and Pacific oceans can cause persistent anticyclonic circulation that not only leads to severe drought but also generates marine heatwaves in the adjacent ocean. We show that increased shortwave radiation due to reduced cloud cover and reduced ocean heat loss from weaker winds are the main contributors to the establishment of marine heatwaves in the region. The proposed mechanism, which involves droughts, extreme air temperature over land and atmospheric blocking explains approximately 60% of the marine heatwave events in the western South Atlantic. We also identified an increase in frequency, duration, intensity and extension of marine heatwave events over the satellite period 1982–2016. Moreover, surface primary production was reduced during these events with implications for regional fisheries.},

Between March 2017 and March 2018, mean zonal velocity and vertical shear were strongest between 32 and 37 m. Near‐surface mean eastward currents during this period were weaker than the long‐term mean but within the range of previously observed values given the high interannual variability. Interannual variability ofthe zonal velocity exceeded that ofthe meridional velocity, was primarily geostrophically driven, and was strongly influenced by the large‐scale currents. Energetic tropical instability waves (TIWs) were observed in early summer and late fall of 2017. Meridional velocity fluctuations associated with the TIWs were far larger than those of zonal velocity and extended down to 87 m. These fluctuations propagated upward to the surface with vertical phase speeds between 12 and 15 m/day. Coherent velocity and vertical shear variations emerged in a TIW composite. However, the vertical shears observed during the TIW season were modest compared to the large shear measured in spring 2017 and winter 2018. As a result, TIWs may be less crucial for vertical turbulent cooling at 4°N, 23°W than they are near the equator. To observe the intense winter/spring vertical shear events, fine vertical (less than 10 m) and diurnal temporal sampling is needed.},

   abstract = {Between 1996 and the mid-2000s the upper waters (200-700. m) of the Rockall Trough became warmer (+0.72. °C), saltier (+0.088) and reduced in nitrate and phosphate (-2.00. μM and -0.14. μM respectively). These changes, out-with calculated errors, can be explained by the varying influence of southern versus subpolar water masses in the basin as the Subpolar Gyre weakened and contracted. Upper water properties strongly correlate with a measure of the strength of the Subpolar Gyre (the first principal component of sea surface height over the Subpolar North Atlantic) prior to the mid-2000s. As the gyre weakens, the upper layers of the trough become warmer (r-0.85), more saline (r-0.86) and reduced in nitrate and phosphate (r+0.81 and r+0.87 respectively). Further the proportion of subpolar waters in the basin decreases from around 50% to less than 20% (r+0. 88). Since the mid-2000s the Subpolar Gyre has been particularly weak. During this period temperatures decreased slightly (-0.21. °C), salinities remained near constant (35.410±0.005) and phosphate levels low and stable (0.68±0.02. μM). These relative lack of changes are thought to be related to the maximum proportion of southern water masses within the Rockall Trough having been reached. Thus the upper water properties are no longer controlled by changes in the relative importance of different water masses in the basin (as prior to the mid-2000s), but rather a different process. We suggest that when the gyre is particularly weak the interannual changes in upper water properties in the Rockall Trough reflect changes in the source properties of the southern water masses. Since the early-2000s the Subpolar Gyre has been weaker than observed since 1992, or modelled since 1960-1970. Hence upper waters within the Rockall Trough may be warmer, saltier and more depleted in nitrate and phosphate than at any time in the last half century. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Repeat glider sections obtained during 2014–2016, as part of the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program, are used to quantify the circulation and transport of North Atlantic Current (NAC) branches over the Rockall Plateau. Using 16 glider sections collected along 58°N and between 21°W and 15°W, absolute geostrophic velocities are calculated, and subsequently the horizontal and vertical structure of the transport are characterized. The annual mean northward transport (± standard deviation) is 5.1 ± 3.2 Sv over the Rockall Plateau. During summer (May to October), the mean northward transport is stronger and reaches 6.7 ± 2.6 Sv. This accounts for 43% of the total NAC transport of upper-ocean waters (σO<27.55 kg/m3) estimated by Sarafanov et al. (2012, https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JC007572) along 59.5°N, between the Reykjanes Ridge and Scotland. Two quasi-permanent northward flowing branches of the NAC are identified: (i) the Hatton Bank Jet (6.3 ± 2.1 Sv) over the eastern flank of the Iceland Basin (20.5°W to 18.5°W) and (ii) the Rockall Bank Jet (1.5 ± 0.7 Sv) over the eastern flank of the Hatton-Rockall Basin (16°W to 15°W). Transport associated with the Rockall Bank Jet is mostly depth independent during summer, while 30% of the Hatton Bank Jet transport is due to vertical geostrophic shear. Uncertainties are estimated for each individual glider section using a Monte Carlo approach, and mean uncertainties of the absolute transport are less than 0.5 Sv. Although comparisons with altimetry-based estimates indicate similar large-scale circulation patterns, altimetry data do not resolve small mesoscale current bands in the Hatton-Rockall Basin which are strongly needed for the right transport estimates.},

   abstract = {We present version 4 of the Met Office Hadley Centre "EN" series of data sets of global quality controlled ocean temperature and salinity profiles and monthly objective analyses, which covers the period 1900 to present. We briefly describe the EN4 data sources, processing, quality control procedures, and the method of generating the analyses. In particular, we highlight improvements relative to previous versions, which include a new duplicate profile removal procedure and the inclusion of three new quality control checks. We discuss in detail a novel method for providing uncertainty estimates for the objective analyses and improving the background error variance estimates used by the analysis system. These were calculated using an iterative method that is relatively robust to initial misspecification of background error variances. We also show how the method can be used to identify issues with the analyses such as those caused by misspecification of error variances and demonstrate the impact of changes in the observing system on the uncertainty in the analyses.

   abstract = {We review the state-of-the-art knowledge of Tropical Atlantic Variability (TAV). A well-developed observing system and sustained effort of the climate modeling community have improved our understanding of TAV. It is dominated by the seasonal cycle, for which some mechanisms have been identified. The interannual TAV presents a marked seasonality with three dominant modes: (i) the Atlantic Zonal Mode (AZM), (ii) the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) and (iii) the variability in the Angola–Benguela Front (ABF). At longer time scales, the AMM is active and low-frequency variations in the strength, periodicity, and spatial structure of the AZM are observed. Also, changes in the mean position of the ABF occur. Climate models still show systematic biases in the simulated TAV. Their causes are model-dependent and relate to drawbacks in the physics of the models and to insufficient resolution of their atmospheric and oceanic components. The identified causes for the biases can have local or remote origin, involving the global ocean and atmospheric circulation. Although there is not a clear consensus regarding the role of model resolution in the representation of the TAV, eddy-resolving ocean models combined with atmospheric models with enhanced horizontal and vertical resolutions simulate smaller biases.},

   abstract = {Detection of a periodic signal hidden in noise is frequently a goal in astronomical data analysis. This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly beheved in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples.},

   abstract = {The barrier formed by the Greenland-Scotland-Ridge (GSR) shapes the oceanic conditions in the region around Iceland. Deep water cannot be exchanged across the ridge, and only limited water mass exchange in intermediate layers is possible through deep channels, where the flow is directed southwestward (the Nordic Overflows). As a result, the near-bottom water masses in the deep basins of the northern North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas hold major temperature differences.Here, we use near-bottom measurements of about 88,000 CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) and bottle profiles, collected in the period 1900-2008, to investigate the distribution of near-bottom properties. Data are gridded into regular boxes of about 11 km size and interpolated following isobaths. We derive average spatial temperature and salinity distributions in the region around Iceland, showing the influence of the GSR on the near-bottom hydrography. The spatial distribution of standard deviation is used to identify local variability, which is enhanced near water mass fronts.Finally, property changes within the period 1975-2008 are presented using time series analysis techniques for a collection of grid boxes with sufficient data resolution. Seasonal variability, as well as long term trends are discussed for different bottom depth classes, representing varying water masses. The seasonal cycle is most pronounced in temperature and decreases with depth (mean amplitudes of 2.2 °C in the near surface layers vs. 0.2 °C at depths >500. m), while linear trends are evident in both temperature and salinity (maxima in shallow waters of +0.33 °C/decade for temperature and +0.03/decade for salinity).},

   abstract = {Abstract The Eastern Tropical North Atlantic Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) is a biogeochemically important area. The low oxygen in this region is thought to be maintained by a balance between the slow mixing supply of O2 and its removal by respiration. We use data from 90 isopycnal RAFOS floats to characterize the mixing coefficients responsible for the supply of oxygen to the region. One group was ballasted to drift on the isopycnal where oxygen is at its minimum and the other about 300 m deeper. Using the record of the float positions at each 6-hr interval, we calculate the relative dispersion of pairs of floats. The time derivative of this dispersion provides a diffusivity coefficient that captures the net effect of eddy-driven mixing along each isopycnal. Float pairs deployed at shared locations but across the two target densities reveal that the influence of vertically sheared currents is to accelerate the dispersion by 10–15% relative to true isopycnal dispersion. Relative dispersion of the floats in the OMZ area obeyed the canonical four-thirds power scaling, representative of two-dimensional turbulence. At the length scale of the maximum energy-containing eddy (approximately 100 km), the effective diffusivity is 1,400±500 m2/s in the zonal direction and 800±300 m2/s in the meridional. Within the uncertainty, the diffusivities on the two isopycnals are indistinguishable from one another. An idealized model suggests that meridional mixing across the large-scale O2 gradient is the leading supply term of oxygen to the OMZ.},

   abstract = {AbstractThe eastern boundary region off Angola encompasses a highly productive ecosystem important for the food security of the coastal population. The fish-stock distribution, however, undergoes large variability on intraseasonal, interannual, and longer time scales. These fluctuations are partly associated with large-scale warm anomalies that are often forced remotely from the equatorial Atlantic and propagate southward, reaching the Benguela upwelling off Namibia. Such warm events, named Benguela Niños, occurred in 1995 and in 2011. Here we present results from an underexplored extensive in situ dataset that was analyzed in the framework of a capacity-strengthening effort. The dataset was acquired within the Nansen Programme executed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and funded by the Norwegian government. It consists of hydrographic and velocity data from the Angolan continental margin acquired biannually during the main downwelling and upwelling seasons over more than 20 years. The mean seasonal changes of the Angola Current from 6° to 17°S are presented. During austral summer the southward Angola Current is concentrated in the upper 150 m. It strengthens from north to south, reaching a velocity maximum just north of the Angola Benguela Front. During austral winter the Angola Current is weaker, but deeper reaching. While the southward strengthening of the Angola Current can be related to the wind forcing, its seasonal variability is most likely explained by coastally trapped waves. On interannual time scales, the hydrographic data reveal remarkable variability in subsurface upper-ocean heat content. In particular, the 2011 Benguela Niño was preceded by a strong subsurface warming of about 2 years? duration.},

   abstract = {Reconstructions of salinity are used to diagnose changes in the hydrological cycle and ocean circulation. A widely used method of determining past salinity uses oxygen isotope (δ Ow ) residuals after the extraction of the global ice volume and temperature components. This method relies on a constant relationship between δ Ow and salinity throughout time. Here we use the isotope-enabled fully coupled General Circulation Model (GCM) HadCM3 to test the application of spatially and time-independent relationships in the reconstruction of past ocean salinity. Simulations of the Late Holocene (LH), Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and Last Interglacial (LIG) climates are performed and benchmarked against existing compilations of stable oxygen isotopes in carbonates (δ Oc ), which primarily reflect δ Ow and temperature. We find that HadCM3 produces an accurate representation of the surface ocean δ Oc distribution for the LH and LGM. Our simulations show considerable variability in spatial and temporal δ Ow -salinity relationships. Spatial gradients are generally shallower but within ~50% of the actual simulated LH to LGM and LH to LIG temporal gradients and temporal gradients calculated from multi-decadal variability are generally shallower than both spatial and actual simulated gradients. The largest sources of uncertainty in salinity reconstructions are found to be caused by changes in regional freshwater budgets, ocean circulation, and sea ice regimes. These can cause errors in salinity estimates exceeding 4 psu. Our results suggest that paleosalinity reconstructions in the South Atlantic, Indian and Tropical Pacific Oceans should be most robust, since these regions exhibit relatively constant δ Ow -salinity relationships across spatial and temporal scales. Largest uncertainties will affect North Atlantic and high latitude paleosalinity reconstructions. Finally, the results show that it is difficult to generate reliable salinity estimates for regions of dynamic oceanography, such as the North Atlantic, without additional constraints.},

The model is forced by a white-noise wind, and a spectral analysis of the zonal and meridional, barotropic and baroclinic velocity components is carried out. Several dynamical features are identified in terms of boundary-driven Rossby waves, and their spatial structure and frequency dependence are examined theoretically and discussed in connection with recent studies based on altimeter data. In particular, the following aspects of the variability are analyzed: 1) beta-refracted baroclinic Rossby waves, which are found to be generated along the eastern boundary of the ocean by the passage of coastal Kelvin waves originating from the equatorial waveguide, and 2) westward-intensified barotropic Rossby waves, which originate from the western boundary of the ocean after reflection of longer waves generated in midocean. In the discussion the stress is put on dynamical aspects not yet fully understood and on the possibility that altimetry can provide further insight into their functioning.},

Different types of long Rossby waves (with the characteristic scales between 1000 and 2500 km) are identified in the western [west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR)] and eastern [east of the MAR] subbasins. Along-shore wind fluctuations and an equatorially forced coastal Kelvin wave were found to be responsible for the excitation of annual- and semiannual-propagating Rossby waves in the eastern subbasin. These waves are transmitted along a waveguide formed by the African shelf and the MAR. The speed of their propagation varies in magnitude and direction because of bottom topography and irregularity of the coastline. Unstable standing Rossby waves with annual and semiannual periods are shown in both the subbasins. All unstable waves, decaying, radiate shorter free Rossby waves propagating both westward and northwestward, with speeds of up to 10 cm/s. The standing Rossby waves are probably excited by the wind-driven Ekman pumping alone or in combination with linear and nonlinear resonance mechanisms. The additional analysis of subsurface float tracks from May 2005 through May 2006 supports the obtained results. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {This paper examines the linear response of a motionless stratified ocean in the presence of large-scale topography aligned north-south to a wind stress turned on at time zero. An unstratified ocean is first examined. Its response differs from the barotropic response discussed by Anderson and Gill (1975, Spin-up of a stratified ocean, with application to upwelling. Deep-Sea Research, 22, 583-596) in two major respects: a higher frequency 'basin mode' dominates much of the solution, and thinning boundary layers can occur to the east of the topography. The position of the topography strongly affects the properties of the solution. When stratification is included, both barotropic and baroclinic responses are possible. The baroclinic response is affected very little by topography, and essentially the baroclinic spin-up resembles the flat-bottom case. The barotropic response, however, is very different from the unstratified case. Initially the response resembles the unstratified case-in particular the high frequency basin modes are unaffected by stratification-but the slow westward propagation of the baroclinic planetary wave leaves in its wake what is essentially a steady, flat-bottom Sverdrup solution for both barotropic and baroclinic modes. This can be interpreted as there being no motion at great depth, which removes the topographic effect. © 1977.},

The seasonal variations of the EUC in the Gulf of Guinea were even more pronounced. During the boreal summer and fall, the current weakened, while the local ZPG reversed direction compared to the west. The stronger penetration of the EUC into the gulf occurred in the alternate seasons when there was no local reversal in the eastward acting ZPG force.

The north countercurrent often lies below eastward flow, but its core is marked by a subthermocline velocity maximum and a path differing from that of the navifacial core. Between about 50 and 40°W, available data indicate a mean transport of 9 ? 106 m3 s?1 in February?April and 26 ? 106 m3 s?1 in July?September, a significant annual variation. From 40 to 28°W, roughly, evidence for a permanent subthermocline countercurrent is strongest. The current has a mean uninterrupted width of 231 km. Its transport shows no significant annual variation and has a mean of 19 ? 106 m3 s?1. East of about 28°W, the north countercurrent breaks up. The flux mode of the south, and the strong sector of the north, countercurrent is in the layer from 120 to 140 cl t?1, the main part of the equatorial thermostad. Transports of the Atlantic subthermocline countercurrents are considerably larger than these reported for their Pacific counterparts.},

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) generates the so-called SST anomaly tripole. A rather similar SST anomaly tripole, with the subpolar anomaly displaced to the east and a more contracted subtropical anomaly, which is referred to as the North Atlantic horseshoe pattern, in turn influences the atmosphere. In the fall and early winter, the response is NAO like and primarily results from subpolar forcing centered over the Labrador Sea and off Newfoundland. In summer, the largest atmospheric response to SST resembles the east Atlantic pattern and results from a combination of subpolar and tropical forcing. To emphasize the interannual to multidecadal variability, the same analysis is repeated after low-pass filtering. The SST influence is dominated by the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), which also has a horseshoe shape, but with larger amplitude in the subpolar basin. Awarm AMO phase leads to an atmospheric warming limited to the lower troposphere in summer, while it leads to a negative phase of the NAO in winter. The winter influence of the AMO is suggested to be primarily forced by the Atlantic SSTs in the northern subtropics. Such influence of the AMO is found in winter instead of early winter because the winter SST anomalies have a larger persistence, presumably because of SST reemergence.},

   abstract = {A global reference state of the subtropical mode water and permanent pycnocline properties for the 2000–2015 period is presented. The climatology is obtained from a pattern recognition algorithm applied to stratification profiles from the Argo global array. The stratification features are identified as permanent upper ocean pycnostad and pycnocline even when the seasonal pycnocline is developed. The climatology shows that both Northern Hemisphere subtropical gyres have a qualitatively very similar stratification structure. The permanent pycnoclines in the North Atlantic and North Pacific show two deep centers colocated with thick subtropical and subpolar mode waters. These centers coincide with modes in the density and stratification space. These deep pycnocline centers are separated by a region with a shallower and thinner permanent pycnocline that is located downstream of Western Boundary Current Extensions and upstream of Eastern Subtropical Fronts. This feature creates a remarkable double-bowl pattern at the basin scale. In the subtropical gyres of the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans, the mode water and permanent pycnocline structures are characterized by two modes in the density and stratification space that, unlike in the Northern Hemisphere, do not necessarily correspond to deep and thick permanent pycnocline regions. In the subtropical gyre of the South Indian Ocean, a single mode is found to correspond to a single center in the western part of the gyre. This study also shows that away from these deep centers where the pycnocline depth almost follows isopycnals, the permanent pycnocline experiences significant thermohaline gradients that are not density compensated.},

   abstract = {In the North Atlantic, there are pronounced gyre-scale changes in ocean heat content on interannual-to-decadal time scales, which are associated with changes in both sea surface temperature and thermocline thickness; the subtropics are often warm with a thick thermocline when the subpolar gyre is cool with a thin thermocline, and vice versa. This climate variability is investigated using a semidiagnostic dynamical analysis of historical temperature and salinity data from 1962 to 2011 together with idealized isopycnic model experiments. On time scales of typically 5 yr, the tendencies in upper-ocean heat content are not simply explained by the area-averaged atmospheric forcing for each gyre but instead dominated by heat convergences associated with the meridional overturning circulation. In the subtropics, the most pronounced warming events are associated with an increased influx of tropical heat driven by stronger trade winds. In the subpolar gyre, the warming and cooling events are associated with changes in western boundary density, where increasing Labrador Sea density leads to an enhanced overturning and an influx of subtropical heat. Thus, upper-ocean heat content anomalies are formed in a different manner in the subtropical and subpolar gyres, with different components of the meridional overturning circulation probably excited by the local imprint of atmospheric forcing.},

The product of bin averages over spatial scales on the order of 200 to 500 km, reproducing most of the interannual variability in different time series covering at least the last three decades or of the along-track ship monitoring. Comparisons with other SSS and SST gridded products available since 1950 suggest that BINS captures the large decadal to multidecadal variability. Comparison with the HadSST3 SST product since 1896 also indicates that the decadal and multidecadal variability is usually well-reproduced, with small differences in long-term trends or in areas with marginal data coverage in either of the two products. Outside of the Labrador Sea and Greenland margins, interannual variability is rather similar in different seasons. Variability at periods longer than 15 years is a large part of the total interannual variability, both for SST and SSS, except possibly in the south-western part of the domain. Variability in SST and SSS increases towards the west, with the contribution of salinity variability to density dominating that of temperature in the western Atlantic, except close to the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current in the southwest area. Weaker variability and larger relative temperature contributions to density changes are found in the eastern part of the gyre and south of Iceland.},

In particular, when tropical VWS is under the weakening phase and thus favorable for increased hurricane activity in the Main Development Region (MDR), a protective barrier of high VWS inhibits hurricane intensification along the U.S. East Coast. Here we show that this pattern is driven mostly by natural decadal variability, but that greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing erodes the pattern and degrades the natural barrier along the U.S. coast. Twenty-first century climate model projections show that the increased VWS along the U.S. East Coast during decadal periods of enhanced hurricane activity is substantially reduced by GHG forcing, which allows hurricanes approaching the U.S. coast to intensify more rapidly. The erosion of this natural intensification barrier is especially large following the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (rcp8.5) emission scenario.},

Estimates of <i>Î¸</i>-<i>S</i> indices and volume flow rate of the current carrying the AW in the Eurasian Basin were obtained. The assessments were based on the analysis of CTD data including 33 sections in the Eurasian Basin, 4 transects in the St. Anna Trough and 2 transects in the Makarov Basin; additionally a CTD transect of the PolarStern-1996 expedition (PS-96) was considered. Using spatial distributions of temperature, salinity, and density on the transects and applying <i>Î¸</i>-<i>S</i> analysis, the variability of thermohaline pattern on the AW pathway along the slope of Eurasian Basin was investigated. The Fram Strait branch of the Atlantic Water (FSBW) was satisfactorily identified on all transects, including two transects in the Makarov Basin (along 159Â° E), while the Ñold waters, which can be associated with the influence of the Barents Sea branch of the Atlantic water (BSBW), on the transects along 126Â° E, 142Â° E and 159Â° E, were observed in the depth range below 800 m and had a negligible effect on the spatial structure of isopycnic surfaces. Special attention was paid to the variability of the volume flow rate of the AW propagating along the continental slope of the Eurasian Basin. The geostrophic volume flow rate was calculated using the dynamic method. An interpretation of the spatial and temporal variability of hydrological parameters characterizing the flow of the AW in the Eurasian Basin is presented. The geostrophic volume flow rate decreases significantly farther away from the areas of the AW inflow to the Eurasian Basin. Thus, the geostrophic estimate of the volume rate for the AW flow in the Makarov Basin at 159Â° E was found to be more than an order of magnitude smaller than the estimates of the volume flow rate in the Eurasian Basin, implying that the major part of the AW entering the Arctic Ocean circulates cyclonically within the Nansen and Amundsen Basins. There is an absolute maximum of <i>Î¸</i><sub>max</sub> (AW core temperature) in 2006–2008 time series and a maximum in 2013, but only at 103Â° E. Salinity <i>S</i>(<i>Î¸</i><sub>max</sub>) (AW core salinity) time series display an increase of the AW salinity in 2006–2008 and 2013 (at 103Â° E) that can be referred to as a AW salinization in the early 2000-ies. The maxima of <i>Î¸</i><sub>max</sub> and <i>S</i>(<i>Î¸</i><sub>max</sub>) in 2006–2008 and 2013 were accompanied by the volume flow rate highs. Additionally the time average volume rates were calculated for the FSBW flow (in the longitude range 31–92Â° E), for the BSBW flow in the St. Anna Trough and for a combined FSBW and BSBW flow in longitude range 94–107Â° E. A detailed discussion of the results is presented.</span>},

Understanding the variability of atmospheric teleconnection in the Southern Hemisphere, however, is still limited in contrast with the well-documented counterpart in the Northern Hemisphere. This study investigates the interannual variability of mid-latitude circulation in the Southern Hemisphere in austral summer based on the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset during 1980–2016. A stationary mid-latitude teleconnection is revealed along the strong Southern Hemisphere westerly jet over the South Atlantic and South Indian Ocean (SAIO). The zonally oriented SAIO pattern represents the first EOF mode of interannual variability of meridional winds at 200 hPa over the region, with a vertical barotropic structure and a zonal wavenumber of 4. It significantly modulates interannual climate variations in the subtropical Southern Hemisphere in austral summer, especially the opposite change in rainfall and surface air temperature between Northwest and Southeast Australia. The SAIO pattern can be efficiently triggered by divergences over mid-latitude South America and the southwest South Atlantic, near the entrance of the westerly jet, which is probably related to the zonal shift of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone. The triggered wave train is then trapped within the Southern Hemisphere westerly jet waveguide and propagates eastward until it diverts northeastward towards Australia at the jet exit, in addition to portion of which curving equatorward at approximately 50° E towards the southwest Indian Ocean.},

   abstract = {<span><strong>Abstract.</strong> Previous studies have indicated that most of the net sinking associated with the downward branch of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) must occur near the subpolar North Atlantic boundaries. In this work we have used monthly mean fields of a high-resolution ocean model (0.1 deg at the equator) to quantify this sinking. To this end we have calculated the Eulerian net vertical transport (<i>W</i><sub>Σ</sub>) from the modelled vertical velocities, its seasonal variability and its spatial distribution under repeated climatological atmospheric forcing conditions. Based on this simulation, we find that for the whole subpolar North Atlantic <i>W</i><sub>Σ</sub> peaks at about −14 Sv at a depth of 1139 m, matching both the mean depth and the magnitude of the meridional transport of the AMOC at 45° N. It displays a seasonal variability of around 10 Sv. Three sinking regimes are identified according to the characteristics of the accumulated W with respect to the distance to the coast: one within the first 110 km and onto the bathymetric slope at around the peak of the boundary current speed (regime <b>I</b>), the second between 110 km and 290 km covering the remainder of the shelf where mesoscale eddies exchange properties (momentum, heat, mass) between the interior and the boundary (regime <b>II</b>), and the third sinking regime at larger distances from the coast where <i>W</i><sub>Σ</sub> is mostly driven by the ocean's interior eddies (regime <b>III</b>). Regimes <b>I</b> and <b>II</b> accumulate â¼ 90 % of the total sinking and display smaller seasonal changes and spatial variability than regime <b>III</b>. We find that such a distinction in regimes is also useful to describe the characteristics of <i>W</i><sub>Σ</sub> in marginal seas located far from the overflow areas, although the regime boundaries can shift a few tens of km inshore or offshore depending on the bathymetric slope and shelf width of each marginal sea. The largest contributions to the sinking come from the Labrador Sea, the Newfoundland region and the overflow regions. The magnitude, the seasonal variability and the depth at which <i>W</i><sub>Σ</sub> peaks vary for each region, thus revealing a complex picture of sinking in the subpolar North Atlantic.</span>},

   abstract = {In the framework of a sea-ice/ocean general circulation model coupled to an energy balance atmospheric model, an intensity oscillation of Southern Hemisphere (SH) westerly winds affects the global ocean circulation via not only the buoyancy-driven teleconnection (BDT) mode but also the Ekman-driven teleconnection (EDT) mode. The BDT mode is activated by the SH air/sea-ice/ocean interactions such as polynyas and oceanic convection. The ensuing variation in the Antarctic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) that is indicative of the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation exerts a significant influence on the abyssal circulation of the globe, particularly the Pacific. This controls the bipolar seesaw balance between deep and bottom waters at the equator. The EDT mode controlled by northward Ekman transport under the oscillating SH westerly winds generates a signal that propagates northward along the upper ocean and passes through the equator. The variation in the western boundary current (WBC) is much stronger in the North Atlantic than in the North Pacific, which appears to be associated with the relatively strong and persistent Mindanao Current, i.e., the southward flowing WBC of the North Pacific tropical gyre. The North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation is controlled by salt advected northward by the North Atlantic WBC.},

Climate models indicate that changes to the AMOC both herald and drive climate shifts. Intensive trans-basin AMOC observational systems have been put in place to continuously monitor meridional volume transport variability, and in some cases, heat, freshwater and carbon transport. These observational programs have been used to diagnose the magnitude and origins of transport variability, and to investigate impacts of variability on essential climate variables such as sea surface temperature, ocean heat content and coastal sea level. AMOC observing approaches vary between the different systems, ranging from trans-basin arrays (OSNAP, RAPID 26°N, 11°S, SAMBA 34.5°S) to arrays concentrating on western boundaries (e.g., RAPID WAVE, MOVE 16°N). In this paper, we outline the different approaches (aims, strengths and limitations) and summarize the key results to date. We also discuss alternate approaches for capturing AMOC variability including direct estimates (e.g., using sea level, bottom pressure, and hydrography from autonomous profiling floats), indirect estimates applying budgetary approaches, state estimates or ocean reanalyses, and proxies. Based on the existing observations and their results, and the potential of new observational and formal synthesis approaches, we make suggestions as to how to evaluate a comprehensive, future-proof observational network of the AMOC to deepen our understanding of the AMOC and its role in global climate.},

Climate teleconnections with a region's rainfall, with drought and flooding implications, should be part of short- and long-term water management planning and operations. In this study, the link between drought and climatic drivers was assessed by using historical data from 110 years of regional rainfall in southern Florida and the Everglades. The objective was to evaluate historical drought and its link with global oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) assesses regional historical drought in 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-, and 60-month periods. Each of the SPIs was used to analyze the association of different magnitudes of drought with ENSO, AMO, and PDO. Historical drought evaluated in different time windows indicated that there is a wet and dry cycle in the regional hydrology, where the area is currently in the wet phase of the fluctuation since 1995 with some drought years in between. Regional historical rainfall anomaly and drought index relationships with each driver and combination of drivers were statistically evaluated. The impact of ENSO fluctuation is limited to short-period rainfall variability, whereas long-period influence is from AMO and PDO.},

It is possible to isolate one of the competing effects by analysing the vertical shear—the change in wind speed with height—instead of the wind speed, but this approach has not previously been taken. Here we show that, although the zonal wind speed in the North Atlantic polar jet stream at 250 hectopascals has not changed since the start of the observational satellite era in 1979, the vertical shear has increased by 15 per cent (with a range of 11–17 per cent) according to three different reanalysis datasets<sup><a href="#ref-CR15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-CR16">16</a>,<a href="/articles/s41586-019-1465-z#ref-CR17">17</a></sup>. We further show that this trend is attributable to the thermal wind response to the enhanced upper-level meridional temperature gradient. Our results indicate that climate change may be having a larger impact on the North Atlantic jet stream than previously thought. The increased vertical shear is consistent with the intensification of shear-driven clear-air turbulence expected from climate change<sup><a href="#ref-CR18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-CR19">19</a>,<a href="/articles/s41586-019-1465-z#ref-CR20">20</a></sup>, which will affect aviation in the busy transatlantic flight corridor by creating a more turbulent flying environment for aircraft. We conclude that the effects of climate change and variability on the upper-level jet stream are being partly obscured by the traditional focus on wind speed rather than wind shear.},

The seasonality of the AMOC in depth and density spaces is dominated by the Ekman transport from low to high latitudes. At interannual timescales, the AMOC in depth and density spaces has different characteristics, mostly in high latitudes, which is attributed to strong doming of isopycnals. An Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis of the AMOC in depth space demonstrates that the AMOC can be decomposed into two portions – one associated with Labrador Sea winter convection and one related to Ekman transport. The Ekman transport portion of the depth-space AMOC has a general out-of-phase relationship between high and low latitudes and the AMOC becomes more meridionally coherent after the Ekman transport portion is removed. Our study suggests that the AMOC in depth space appears to have two regimes, a strong one before 2001, and a weak one after 2001, which is seen to be associated with the westward movement of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation centers of action starting from 2001. The two-regime behavior is best reflected in the variability of the western part of the Labrador Current, while the general decline over this period is also seen in the Labrador Sea convection depth, the strength of the eastern part of the Labrador Current, and the downward movement of isopycals in the deep layers of the Labrador Sea The latter suggests that hydrographic changes in Labrador Sea deep layers could be potentially used as a proxy for AMOC variability.</p>},

   abstract = {The Northwest Atlantic is a key region with an essential role in global climate regulation, redistributing heat and influencing the carbon cycle. However, little is known about its evolution before 1950, mainly because of the lack of long-term instrumental measurements. The hard parts of long-lived marine biota hold the potential to extend instrumentally derived observation by several decades or centuries and enhance our understanding of global climate processes. Here, we investigate the effects of local, regional, and large-scale climate variability on the marine bivalve, <i>Arctica islandica</i> (<a href="#B40">Linnaeus, 1767</a>) from Saint-Pierre and Miquelon (SPM). This archipelago lies at the boundary zone between the cold Labrador Current in the north and the warm Gulf Stream waters to the south, an excellent site to capture changes in North Atlantic climate and oceanography. This study presents the northernmost, statistically robust <i>A. islandica</i> growth chronology (1850–2015) from the Western North Atlantic and its potential as an environmental proxy record for past climatic and hydrographic variabilities at different time and geographical scales. In view of our results, it seems that <i>A. islandica</i> shell growth anomalies in SPM are mostly controlled by local primary production. Since long term instrumental records of this environmental variable are not available; we investigate the influence of global and regional environmental phenomena on <i>A. islandica</i> growth and indirectly on primary productivity of archipelago waters. The chronology correlates significantly and positively with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and negatively with the North Atlantic Oscillation, two global climatic indices. The North Atlantic spatial pattern of correlation shows significant and positive correlations of 0–100 m temperatures from 1950 with <i>A. islandica</i> growth in SPM encompassing the subpolar gyre area. These global-scale relationships are refined and the mechanisms leading to them explained by comparing <i>A. islandica</i> growth chronology to regional environmental datasets. These relationships existing between the <i>A. islandica</i> shell growth record at SPM and environmental datasets covering different geographical scales could yield details about past North Atlantic basin and regional environmental conditions through their influence on SPM coastal environment.},

   abstract = {The likelihood of an El Niño breaking the annual global mean surface temperature (GMST) record during the 21st century is derived from 38 climate models from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We find that, under a low emission scenario, one out of three El Niño events break the GMST record. The probability significantly increases to four out of five in a high emission scenario. About half of strong El Niños, but only one-fifth of weak El Niños, can set new GMST records in a low emission scenario. By contrast, even weak El Niños break the GMST record more regularly (68 ± 8% chance) in a high emission scenario. Both a stronger El Niño and a higher emission scenario induce a higher record-breaking GMST with a magnitude range from 0.03°C to 0.21°C above the previous record. El Niño accounts for more than half of record-breaking GMST occurrences in all emission scenarios. A comparison between CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6 suggests that the analyses are not affected by model generations.
The efficiency and rapidity of El Niño in pushing up the record warm global mean surface temperature (GMST) have been demonstrated in recent decades, notably during the strong 1997/98 and 2015/16 El Niños. As a naturally-occurring phenomenon, an El Niño can cause a strong and transient warmth of the global climate, superimposed on the gradual and persistent warming induced by greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing (Newell and Weare <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib16">1976</a>, Pan and Oort <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib19">1983</a>, Timmermann <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib27">1999</a>, Trenberth <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib29">2002</a>). The gradual background warming continues to shift the probability distribution of GMST toward higher values, thereby increasing the chance of record-breaking GMST once any internal fluctuation occurs (Wergen and Krug <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib30">2010</a>). Recently, Power and Delage (<a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib20">2019</a>) demonstrate the likelihood of a monthly record-breaking surface temperature occuring under different future scenarios. Since 1980, 11 out of 14 record-breaking annual GMSTs have coincided with an El Niño event (Yin <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib32">2018</a>). Over a long period, these record-breaking GMSTs reflect the general warming trend (Su <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib24">2017</a>), while on short timescales, they reveal extreme events with non-linearity or threshold behaviors inherent in the climate system (Yin <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib32">2018</a>).
The interactions between El Niño and global warming and their combined effect on GMST are important topics in climate change detection and attribution (Foster and Rahmstorf <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib9">2011</a>). During the 21st century, GHG forcing is projected to alter the characteristics and statistics of El Niño, such as its frequency, amplitude, duration, pattern, and teleconnection (Chen <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib5">2016</a>). Besides El Niño, other factors can also influence GMST variations on various timescales, including the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV)/Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) (Meehl <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib13">2016</a>, Su <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib24">2017</a>), Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV) (Schlesinger and Ramankutty <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib22">1994</a>, Zhang <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib36">2007</a>, Muller <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib15">2013</a>), Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Schleussner <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib23">2014</a>), and Arctic Oscillation (AO) (Buermann <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib3">2003</a>, Zanchettin <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib34">2013</a>).
Regardless of the many factors listed above, Trenberth (<a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib29">2002</a>) shows the importance of diabatic heating from the tropical Pacific ocean on the GMST. Thus, when an El Niño occurs during the 21st century, an important question for near-term climate change prediction would be: <em>how likely is the El Niño to break the GMST record, and by how much</em>? To answer this, we analyze the historical simulations and future projections from 38 climate models in the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) (Taylor <em>et al</em> <a class="cite hastip" href="#erlab3b82bib25">2011</a>), supplemented with the results from CMIP3 and CMIP6. It should be noted that we do not attempt to make actual and real-time predictions for particular events, but rather to o

A well-developed observing system and sustained effort of the climate modeling community have improved our understanding of TAV. It is dominated by the seasonal cycle, for which some mechanisms have been identified. The interannual TAV presents a marked seasonality with three dominant modes: (i) the Atlantic Zonal Mode (AZM), (ii) the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) and (iii) the variability in the Angola–Benguela Front (ABF). At longer time scales, the AMM is active and low-frequency variations in the strength, periodicity, and spatial structure of the AZM are observed. Also, changes in the mean position of the ABF occur. Climate models still show systematic biases in the simulated TAV. Their causes are model-dependent and relate to drawbacks in the physics of the models and to insufficient resolution of their atmospheric and oceanic components. The identified causes for the biases can have local or remote origin, involving the global ocean and atmospheric circulation. Although there is not a clear consensus regarding the role of model resolution in the representation of the TAV, eddy-resolving ocean models combined with atmospheric models with enhanced horizontal and vertical resolutions simulate smaller biases.},

The hydrographic dataset at the center of this work is the A22WOCE section, which lies along 66°W and creates a closed volume with the North and South American coasts to its west. The planetary vorticity flux across A22 is quantified, providing a metric for the net meridional flow in the western subtropical gyre. The wind stress forcing over the subtropical gyre to the west and east of the A22 section is calculated from several wind stress data products. These observational budget terms are found to be consistent with an approximate barotropic Sverdrup balance in the eastern subtropical gyre, and are on the same order as budget terms in the ECCO state estimate. The ECCO vorticity budget is closed by bottom pressure torques in the western subtropical gyre, which is consistent with previous studies. In sum, the analysis provides observational ground truth for the North Atlantic subtropical vorticity balance, and explores the seasonal variability of this balance for the first time using the ECCO state estimate. This balance is found to hold on monthly timescales in ECCO, suggesting that the integrated subtropical gyre responds to forcing through fast barotropic adjustment.},

A passive tracer driven by satellite-derived surface velocity fields is used to study the regional and temporal variability of lateral eddy mixing in the North Atlantic.

The interannual variability is 10-20% of the time-mean in both regions. By analysing linear perturbations of mixing-length diffusivity expression, we show that the across-jet mixing in the up-stream region is driven by variations in the mean-flow, rather than eddy velocity. In the down-stream region, both the mean-flow and eddy velocity contribute to the temporal variability. Our results suggest that an eddy parameterisation must take into account the along-jet variation of mixing, and within jets such diffusivities may be a simple function of jet strength.},

Using an idealized model, we focus on the role of eddying marginal seas, where dense water is formed by deep convection due to an intense surface heat loss. We assess where diapycnal mass fluxes take place, investigate the pathways of dense water masses, and elucidate the role of eddies. We find that there are fundamental differences between the Eulerian and diapycnal downwelling: the strong Eulerian near-boundary downwelling is not associated with substantial diapycnal downwelling; the latter takes place in the interior and elsewhere in the boundary current. We show that the diapycnal downwelling appears to be more appropriate to describe the pathways of water masses. In our model, dense water masses are exported along two routes: those formed in the upper part of the boundary current are exported directly; those formed in the interior move towards the boundary along isopycnals due to eddy stirring and are then exported. This study thus reveals a complex three-dimensional view of the overturning in a marginal sea, with possible implications for our understanding of the AMOC.},

These implications have inspired a wealth of model‐ and observation‐based analyses. Here, we review this research, finding consistent support in numerical models for an antiphase relationship between AMOC strength and dynamic sea level. However, simulations exhibit substantial along‐coast and intermodel differences in the amplitude of AMOC‐associated dynamic sea level variability. Observational analyses focusing on shorter (generally less than decadal) timescales show robust relationships between some components of the North Atlantic large‐scale circulation and coastal sea level variability, but the causal relationships between different observational metrics, AMOC, and sea level are often unclear. We highlight the importance of existing and future research seeking to understand relationships between AMOC and its component currents, the role of ageostrophic processes near the coast, and the interplay of local and remote forcing. Such research will help reconcile the results of different numerical simulations with each other and with observations, inform the physical origins of covariability, and reveal the sensitivity of scaling relationships to forcing, timescale, and model representation. This information will, in turn, provide a more complete characterization of uncertainty in relevant relationships, leading to more robust reconstructions and projections.</p>},

Fresh Polar Water is only transported offshore from the western coast of Greenland and the southern coast of Labrador; other regions have onshore transport of freshwater or little offshore transport. The salty water masses of Irminger and Labrador Sea Water typically have onshore transport, acting to promote subsurface freshening of the Labrador Sea. The freshwater transport via the Polar Water mass experiences a large degree of seasonal variability, while the Irminger and Labrador Sea Water masses do not. Decomposing the freshwater transport into the mean and turbulent components indicates that most regions and water masses have stronger freshwater transport associated with the mean flow while the turbulent flow in often the opposite direction. The only water mass and region where the mean and turbulent freshwater transport act in the same direction is Polar Water along the western margin of Greenland. Model resolution plays an important role in determining cross‐isobath exchange as our results from an identically forced simulation at 1/4° has reduced seasonal cycles, reduced transport, and sometimes transport in the opposite direction when compared against the 1/12° resolution simulations.</p>},

Here we use coupled climate simulations to investigate a previously overlooked link between the two phenomena. We demonstrate that TIO warming reduces rainfall over the tropical Atlantic by strengthening the Walker circulation and increasing atmospheric vertical stability. The resultant ocean salinity increase intensifies the AMOC as salinity anomalies are advected to northern high latitudes. In addition, TIO warming enhances westerly winds over the subpolar North Atlantic, which helps to maintain the stronger AMOC. A TIO warming of 0.1 °C above the mean warming of tropical oceans intensifies the AMOC by ~1 Sv, leading to a stronger interhemispheric asymmetry and a northward shifted ITCZ. Thus, TIO warming could delay the AMOC weakening under greenhouse warming. Indeed, we find that the AMOC weakens more strongly or completely collapses if we suppress TIO warming under the doubled and quadrupled CO<sub>2</sub> scenarios. Simulations replicating the observed tropical ocean warming further confirm this TIO–AMOC link, suggesting that the observed TIO warming might be already playing a role in sustaining the AMOC.},

   abstract = {Themechanisms by which time-dependent wind stress anomalies atmid-latitudes can force variability in the meridional overturning circulation at low latitudes are explored. It is shown that winds are effective at forcing remote variability in the overturning circulation when forcing periods are near the mid-latitude baroclinic Rossby wave basin-crossing time. Remote overturning is required by an imbalance in the mid-latitude mass storage and release resulting from the dependence of the Rossby wave phase speed on latitude. A heuristic theory is developed that predicts the strength and frequency-dependence of the remote overturning well when compared to a two-layer numerical model. The theory indicates that the variable overturning strength, relative to the anomalous Ekman transport, depends primarily on the ratio of the meridional spatial scale of the anomalous wind stress curl to its latitude. For strongly forced systems, a mean deep western boundary current can also significantly enhance the overturning variability at all latitudes. For sufficiently large thermocline displacements, the deep western boundary current alternates between interior and near-boundary pathways in response to fluctuations in the wind, leading to large anomalies in the volume of North Atlantic Deep Water stored at mid-latitudes and in the downstream deep western boundary current transport.},

   abstract = {<p>Understanding the spreading pathways and variability of the intermediate and deep water of the eastern Mediterranean Sea is important, as they influence the water exchange between the MS and the Atlantic Ocean, and thus the North Atlantic circulation and global climate. Using a data set spanning over 8 years (2012–2019; 23 cruises) we describe the recent evolution of the Southeastern Levantine basin deep water and examine the controlling processes of the observed variability. Over a period of 5–6 years (2012 to mid-2017) the salinity minimum zone (located at ∼1000 dbar) experienced a monotonic salinity rise at a rate of ∼0.002 units per year. We demonstrate that this rise can be largely attributed to vertical diffusional processes that gradually eroded this layer. From August 2017, the salinity value at the 1000 dbar level stabilized at 38.76. Close to the bottom of the abyssal plain, we identify the first signal of the arrival of recently formed East Mediterranean Deep Water of Adriatic origin, first reported in the Ionian basin, after the Eastern Mediterranean Transient, in 2001. Additionally, we observe the warming and salinification of isopycnals over the pressure range of 600 to 1200 dbar and track the deepening of the 38.8 iso-haline, by ∼100 dbar over a period of 4 years. These are attributed to the general salinification trend at shallow and intermediate levels of the Southeastern Levantine basin, and possibly also to Cretan intermediate water formation and spreading. These observations highlight the dynamics of the eastern MS water masses, and call for more systematic monitoring of this basin.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>This paper investigates the relationship between long‐term trends (1980–2017) in intensity and wind evolution for tropical cyclones (TCs) within the western tropical Atlantic (WTA) and central/eastern tropical Atlantic (CETA) subbasins. Long‐term TC trends in intensity, intensification time, and wind variability for the CETA were generally more significant than, and in some cases opposite to, those for the WTA. Both the TC intensity levels, as measured by the power dissipation index normalized by storm hours and proportion of rapid intensification intervals (defined as a 12‐hr wind speed increase of 20 kt or more), exhibit no long‐term trends in either subbasin. A TC wind variability index (WVI) calculated over 72‐hr intervals of the TC lifecycle decreases for the WTA over the decades, while the CETA has the 72‐hr intervals with the greatest wind speed fluctuations. The average period of intensification before the peak in TC intensity increases ~0.97 hr/year for the CETA. TC maximum intensity exhibits no trend, suggesting that TCs in the tropical North Atlantic have a trend favoring a longer intensification period to reach their lifetime maximum intensity. A correlation analysis suggests that warmer sea surface temperatures and greater moisture favor longer intensification and greater WVI. In contrast, greater 850‐ to 200‐hPa vertical wind shear is associated with shorter intensification periods and less WVI.</p>},

Here, we assess both the seasonality and the vertical distribution of submesoscale motions in an open ocean region of the northeast Atlantic. Second-order structure functions, or variance in properties separated by distance, are calculated from submesoscale-resolving ocean glider and mooring observations, as well as a 1/48° numerical ocean model. This data set combines a temporal coverage that extends through a full seasonal cycle, a horizontal resolution that captures spatial scales as small as 1 km, and vertical sampling that provides near-continuous coverage over the upper 1000 m. While kinetic and potential energies undergo a seasonal cycle, being largest during the winter, structure function slopes, influenced by dynamical characteristics, do not exhibit a strong seasonality. Furthermore, structure function slopes show weak vertical variations; there is not a strong change in properties across the base of the mixed layer. Additionally, we compare the observations to output from a high-resolution numerical model. The model does not represent variability associated with superinertial motions and does not capture an observed reduction in submesoscale kinetic energy that occurs throughout the water column in spring. Overall, these results suggest that the transfer of mixed layer submesoscale variability down to depths below the traditionally-defined mixed layer is important throughout the weakly stratified subpolar mode waters.},

The formation rates are expressed in three coordinate systems: (1) density, (2) temperature-salinity and (3) latitude-longitude. In the North Atlantic and North Pacific, peak formation occurs south of the western boundary current extensions during the winter months of the study period. In the Southern Ocean, wintertime peak formation occurs just north of the sub-Antarctic Front. The satellite-derived water mass properties and formation areas agree well with previous estimates from literature. The location of peak Mode Water formation varies slightly with time in all coordinate systems. We assess seasonal and inter-annual variability in all three basins from 2012 to 2014. We assess the impact of satellite uncertainties on final estimates of formation rates and areas with Monte-Carlo simulations. The simulations provide insights on the associated uncertainty of formation estimates. They also provide information on the geographic spread of the water mass formation area subject to the satellite errors. We find that the total uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the sea surface salinity dataset. This stresses the need for frequent and increasingly accurate sea surface salinity data for reliable estimates of water mass formation rates and areas. Our study highlights the feasibility of providing satellite-based estimates of water mass formation rates and areas. The good spatio-temporal coverage of satellite data further adds to the utility of the approach.},

   abstract = {<p>A recent study has brought to light the co‐existence of two distinct Atlantic Equatorial Modes during negative phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability: the Atlantic Niño and Horse‐Shoe (HS) mode. Nevertheless, the associated air‐sea interactions for HS mode have not been explored so far and the prevailing dynamic view of the Atlantic Niño has been questioned. Here, using forced ocean model simulations, we find that for both modes, ocean dynamics is essential to explain the equatorial SST variations, while air‐sea fluxes control the off‐equatorial SST anomalies. Moreover, we demonstrate the key role played by ocean waves in shaping their distinct structure and timing. For the positive phase of both Atlantic Niño and HS, anomalous westerly winds trigger a set of equatorial downwelling Kelvin waves (KW) during spring‐summer. These dKWs deepen the thermocline, favouring the equatorial warming through vertical diffusion and horizontal advection. Remarkably, for the HS, an anomalous north‐equatorial wind stress curl excites an upwelling Rossby wave (RW), which propagates westward and is reflected at the western boundary becoming an equatorial upwelling KW. The uKW propagates to the east, activating the thermocline feedbacks responsible to cool the sea surface during summer months. This RW‐reflected mechanism acts as a negative feedback causing the early termination of the HS mode. Our results provide an improvement in the understanding of the TAV modes and emphasize the importance of ocean wave activity to modulate the equatorial SST variability. These findings could be very useful to improve the prediction of the Equatorial Modes.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The Southwestern Atlantic Ocean has one of the largest and most productive continental shelves of the southern hemisphere. Despite its relevance, its circulation patterns have been largely inferred from hydrographic observations and numerical models. Here we describe the variability of the shelf circulation based on the analysis of eleven months of multi‐level currents measured by two bottom‐mounted acoustic Doppler current profilers deployed over the continental shelf at 39°S. The record‐length mean is 12 cm s<sup>‐1</sup> and 13 cm s<sup>‐1</sup> in the upper layer and decreases to 6 cm s<sup>‐1</sup> and 8 cm s<sup>‐1</sup> near the bottom, at the deployment nearer and further from the coast respectively. The mean flow direction is towards the NE, following the orientation of the isobaths. Measurements at both sites show that the along‐shore barotropic component accounts for 83% of the variability observed and are well correlated (0.86), suggesting a relatively uniform flow, which is presumably driven by large‐scale forcing. Indeed, large scale wind stress patterns dominate the temporal variability of the in‐situ currents and the passage of atmospheric fronts induces significant changes in the observed currents at all depths. We found that for 12 % of the measurements the currents reverse the direction to the SW in response to these atmospheric patterns. Furthermore, the analysis of sea surface height reconstructed from bottom pressure measurements at both sites and from a coastal tide gauge reveals that the variability of the along‐shore currents is driven by the cross‐shore pressure gradients generated by the along‐shore wind stress.</p>},

   abstract = {The dipole structure of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is examined in this study by defining the tilt of the NAO dipole centers on synoptic time scales. All the positive NAO phase (NAO+) and negative NAO phase (NAO−) events are divided into three tilting types according to their definition; namely, northeast–southwest (NE–SW), north–south symmetric (N–S, not tilted), and northwest–southeast (NW–SE) tilting NAO events. Then, the associated surface air temperature (SAT), geopotential height, zonal wind, and SST (surface sea temperature) anomalies of each type are examined. It is found that, for different asymmetric NAO tilt types, the local SATs exhibit significantly different distributions. The zonal wind has a good match with the NAO dipole tilt, which also includes the positive feedback of the NAO circulation. The basic zonal flow that removes the NAO days also exhibits a clear tilt structure that favors the tilt of the NAO dipole. Moreover, it is found that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) may be an important factor affecting the tilt of the NAO dipole. The AMO index has a significant 15-year lead for the NAO index and basic zonal flow index, with a high correlation coefficient, which might be seen as a precondition that indicates the tilt of the NAO events, especially on decadal or multidecadal time scales. However, the physical mechanisms and processes are still not fully understood.},

   abstract = {Projected future shoaling of the wintertime mixed layer in the Northeast (NE) Atlantic has been shown to induce a regime shift in the main nutrient supply pathway from the Atlantic to the Northwest European Shelf (NWES) near the end of the 21st century. While reduced winter convection leads to a substantial decrease in the vertical nutrient supply and biological productivity in the open ocean, vertical mixing processes at the shelf break maintain a connection to the subpycnocline nutrient pool and thus productivity on the shelf. Here we investigate how meltwater discharge from the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) not yet taken into account impacts the mixed layer shoaling and the regime shift in terms of spatial distribution and temporal variability. To this end we have downscaled sensitivity experiments by a global earth system model for various GIS melting rates with a regionally coupled ocean-atmosphere climate system model. The model results indicate that increasing GIS meltwater discharge leads to a general intensification of the regime shift. Atlantic subpycnocline water masses mixed up at the shelf break become richer in nutrients and thus limit the projected nutrient decline on the shelf. Moreover, the stronger vertical nutrient gradient through the pycnocline results in an enhanced interannual variability of on-shelf nutrient fluxes which, however, do not significantly increase variations in nutrient concentrations and primary production on the shelf. Moreover, due to the impact of the GIS meltwater discharge on the NE Atlantic mixed layer depth, the regime shift becomes initiated earlier in the century by about 1–2 decades, depending on the discharge rate. The effect on the onset timing, though, is found to be strongly damped by the weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. A GIS melting rate that is even 10 times higher than expected for emission scenario RCP8.5 would lead to an onset of the regime shift not until the 2070s.},

   abstract = {The Nordic Seas is the main ocean conveyor of heat between the North Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. Although the decadal variability of the Subpolar North Atlantic has been given significant attention lately, especially regarding the cooling trend since mid-2000s, less is known about the potential connection downstream in the northern basins. Using sea surface heights from satellite altimetry over the past 25 years (1993–2017), we find significant variability on multiyear-to-decadal time scales in the Nordic Seas. In particular, the regional trends in sea surface height show signs of a slowdown since mid-2000s as compared to the rapid increase in the preceding decade since early 1990s. This change is most prominent in the Atlantic origin waters in the eastern Nordic Seas and is closely linked, as estimated from hydrography, to heat content. Furthermore, we formulate a simple heat budget for the eastern Nordic Seas to discuss the relative importance of local and remote sources of variability; advection of temperature anomalies in the Atlantic inflow is found to be the main mechanism. A conceptual model of ocean heat convergence, with only upstream temperature measurements at the inflow to the Nordic Seas as input, is able to reproduce key aspects of the decadal variability of the Nordic Seas' heat content. Based on these results, we argue that there is a strong connection with the upstream Subpolar North Atlantic. However, although the shift in trends in the mid-2000s is coincident in the Nordic Seas and the Subpolar North Atlantic, the eastern Nordic Seas has not seen a reversal of trends but instead maintain elevated sea surface heights and heat content in the recent decade considered here.},

Results show that the MPI median increases by 4.8, 7.7, 6.4, and 4.4 m s<sup>‐1</sup> per degree increase in SST in the NA, ENP, WNP, and NI, respectively.

The environmental factors that contribute to such inter‐basin differences were compared among basins. The greatest MPI in the ENP is largely contributed by the colder troposphere and drier boundary layer. The warmer troposphere and wetter boundary layer are responsible for the smallest MPI in the WNP. In the NA, the warmer outflow layer reduces the thermodynamic efficiency and partly offsets the positive contributions by the colder troposphere and drier boundary layer, resulting in the moderate MPI. In the WNP, the variability in MPI decreases with increasing SST across all four basins and is the largest. The large variability at low SSTs is largely contributed by the variability in air temperature, which includes both the air‐sea temperature difference and the outflow layer temperature, while the variability at relatively high SSTs is dominantly contributed by boundary layer moisture.</p>},

More than two decades of observations at the sill show strong fluctuations of volume flux on daily time scales. To better understand the source of this variability, a 5‐ mooring array was installed at the sill, capturing nearly one year of velocity and bottom temperature measurements at a high temporal and spatial resolution. Bottom temperature fluctuations that exceed 4° C indicate a meandering of the front between the plume and the NIIC. Current vector rotation shows trains of alternating cyclones and anti‐cyclones at the sill. An eddy crosses the sill every 3 to 6 days with a mean velocity of 0.4 ms<sup>−1</sup> and a typical diameter of 30 to 40 km. The results suggest that anti‐cyclones, with centers passing through the deepest part of the sill, may be responsible for periods of increased volume flux ‐ also referred to as boluses and pulses in previous studies.

An analysis of these different data sets allowed us to reveal almost identical patterns of variability of the thermohaline fields of the North Atlantic, which increases the reliability of the results. Long-term temperature and salinity trends calculated over the period 1948–2017 show that warming and salinization of water occur in the upper ~1 km layer of the North Atlantic. On the contrary, cooling and freshening of deep waters are observed, which is associated with the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, transport of fresher waters from the Arctic Ocean, and deepening of these cold and fresher waters into the deeper layers. Composite analysis of the zonally averaged temperature and salinity anomalies of the North Atlantic waters after removing the trends showed that in the warm AMO periods warming and salinization of waters are observed in the upper 1-km layer of the North Atlantic when compared to the cold periods based both on the EN4 and WOA2013 data. Below the 1-km layer, significant regions of cooling and freshening are observed; this distribution is more pronounced in the EN4 data. Analysis of the dynamics of zonally averaged temperature and salinity anomalies in the successive periods associated with the temporal variability of the AMO index revealed that these anomalies propagate along the zonally averaged meridional thermohaline circulation. To show this using the Institute of Numerical Mathematics Ocean Model (INMOM), the stream function of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) was simulated. It is shown that positive and negative anomalies of both temperature and salinity circulate along the water motion in the AMOC around its core, descending down into the deep ocean layers approximately at 60° N and ascending to the surface at 25° N, replacing each other with a period of about 60 years. It can be assumed that due to this process both the warm and cold phases of the AMO are formed.</p>},

         <p>The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key component of the global
            climate system through its transport of heat and freshwater. The subpolar North Atlantic
            (SPNA) is a region where the AMOC is actively developed and shaped though mixing and
            water mass transformation, and where large amounts of heat are released to the atmosphere.
            Two hydrographic trans‐basin sections in the summers of 2014 and 2016 provide highly
            spatially resolved views of the SPNA velocity and property fields on a line from Canada
            to Greenland to Scotland. Estimates of the AMOC, isopycnal (gyre‐scale) transport,
            and heat and freshwater transport are derived from the observations. The overturning
            circulation, the maximum in northward transport integrated from the surface to seafloor
            and computed in density space, has a high range, with 20.6 ± 4.7 Sv in June‐July 2014
            and 10.6 ± 4.3 Sv in May‐August 2016. In contrast the isopycnal (gyre‐scale) circulation
            was lowest in summer 2014: 41.3 ± 8.2 Sv compared to 58.6 ± 7.4 Sv in 2016. The heat
            transport (0.39 ± 0.08 PW in summer 2014, positive is northwards) was highest for
            the section with the highest AMOC, and the freshwater transport was largest in summer
            2016 when the isopycnal circulation was high (‐0.25 ± 0.08 Sv). Up to 65% of the heat
            and freshwater transport was carried by the isopycnal circulation, with isopycnal
            property transport highest in the western Labrador Sea and the eastern basins (Iceland
            Basin to Scotland).

   abstract = {This paper investigates the causation for the decline of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) from approximately 17 Sv to about 9 Sv, when the atmospheric resolution of the Max Planck Institute ‐ Earth System Model (MPI‐ESM) is enhanced from ~1° to ~ 0.5°.The results show that the slowdown of the AMOC is caused by the cessation of deep convection. In most modelling studies, this is thought to be controlled by buoyancy fluxes in the convective regions, for example by surface freshwater flux that is introduced locally or via enormous input from glacier or iceberg melts. While we find that freshwater is still the key to the reduction of AMOC seen in the higher resolution run, the freshening of the North Atlantic need not be directly caused by local freshwater fluxes. Instead, it can be caused indirectly through winds via a reduced wind‐driven gyre circulation and salinity transport associated to this circulation, as seen in the higher resolution run.},

         <p>Freshwater transports <span>(<i>F</i><sub><i>ov</i></sub></span>) by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are sensitive to salinity distributions and may determine AMOC stability.

   abstract = {Here we explore the water transfer between the subtropical and tropical gyres of the South Atlantic Ocean to better understand its unique equatorward heat delivery. A Lagrangian technique is applied to the reanalysis product GLORYS2V4 in order to trace back the western boundary flow in the tropical (North Brazil Undercurrent, NBUC) and subtropical (Brazil Current) gyres. Most of the northward NBUC core transport (14.9 Sv at 8°S) arrives from the eastern boundary subtropical current (Benguela Current) via the zonal South Equatorial Current. This subtropical-tropical transfer represents the core of the returning limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and accounts for most of the observed increase in heat and salt-volume transports (0.18 PW and 0.19 Sv from 30°S to 8°S, respectively) across the South Atlantic. The NBUC also includes Antarctic Intermediate Water below 400 m (7.4 Sv at 8°S) coming from the interior subtropical gyre, as well as water from the current's surface and peripheral components coming from the tropical gyre (13.3 Sv at 8°S). The Brazil Current (9.9 Sv at 29°S) is mostly composed of subtropical water originating in the upper 800 m west of the eastern boundary current at 30°S (8.5 Sv), with a minor contribution of surface tropical water that transfers to the subtropics (1.4 Sv).},

Over the western U.S. and in a majority of ecoregions, we found significant, increasing trends in the number of large fires and/or total large fire area per year. Trends were most significant for southern and mountain ecoregions, coinciding with trends toward increased drought severity. For all ecoregions combined, the number of large fires increased at a rate of seven fires per year, while total fire area increased at a rate of 355 km2 per year. Continuing changes in climate, invasive species, and consequences of past fire management, added to the impacts of larger, more frequent fires, will drive further disruptions to fire regimes of the western U.S. and other fire-prone regions of the world.},

   abstract = {In this paper we use a coupled ocean-atmosphere model to investigate the impact of the interruption of Agulhas leakage of Indian ocean water on the tropical Atlantic, a region where strong coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions occur. The effect of a shut down of leakage of Indian ocean water is isolated from the effect of a collapse of the MOC. In our experiments, the ocean model is forced with boundary conditions in the southeastern corner of the domain that correspond to no interocean exchange of Indian ocean water into the Atlantic. The southern boundary condition is taken from the Levitus data and ensures an MOC in the Atlantic. Within this configuration, instead of warm and salty Indian ocean water temperature (cold) and salinity (fresh) anomalies of southern ocean origin propagate into the South Atlantic and eventually reach the equatorial region, mainly in the thermocline. This set up mimics the closure of the "warm water path" in favor of the "cold water path". As part of the atmospheric response, there is a northward shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The changes in trade winds lead to reduced Ekman pumping in the equatorial region. This leads to a freshening and warming of the surface waters along the equator. Especially in the Cold Tongue region, the cold and fresh subsurface anomalies do not reach the surface due to the reduced upwelling. The anomaly signals are transported by the equatorial undercurrent and spread away from the equator within the thermocline. Part of the anomaly eventually reaches the Tropical North Atlantic, where it affects the Guinea Dome. Surprisingly, the main effect at the surface is small on the equator and relatively large at the Guinea Dome. In the atmosphere, the northward shift of the ITCZ is associated with a band of negative precipitation anomalies and higher salinities over the Tropical South Atlantic. An important implication of these results is that the modified water characteristics due to a shut down of the Agulhas leakage remain largely unaffected when crossing the equatorial Atlantic and therefore can affect the deepwater formation in the North Atlantic. This supports the hypothesis that the Agulhas leakage is an important source region for climate change and decadal variability of the Atlantic. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Multiple lines of evidence show that cold stadials in the North Atlantic were accompanied by both reductions in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and collapses of the West African Monsoon (WAM). Although records of terrestrial change identify abrupt WAM variability across the deglaciation, few studies show how ocean temperatures evolved across the deglaciation. To identify the mechanism linking AMOC to the WAM, we generated a new record of subsurface temperature variability over the last 21 kyr based on Mg/Ca ratios in a sub-thermocline dwelling planktonic foraminifera in an Eastern Equatorial Atlantic (EEA) sediment core from the Niger Delta. Our subsurface temperature record shows abrupt subsurface warming during both the Younger Dryas (YD) and Heinrich Event 1. We also conducted a new transient coupled ocean-atmosphere model simulation across the YD that better resolves the western boundary current dynamics and find a strong negative correlation between AMOC strength and EEA subsurface temperatures caused by changes in ocean circulation and rainfall responses that are consistent with the observed WAM change. Our combined proxy and modeling results provide the first evidence that an oceanic teleconnection between AMOC strength and subsurface temperature in the EEA impacted the intensity of the WAM on millennial time scales.},

   abstract = {In response to a substantial weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)-from a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model experiment-significant changes in the interannual variability are found over the tropical Atlantic, characterized by an increase of variance (by ~150 %) in boreal late spring-early summer and a decrease of variance (by ~60 %) in boreal autumn. This study focuses on understanding physical mechanisms responsible for these changes in interannual variability in the tropical Atlantic. It demonstrates that the increase of variability in spring is a consequence of an increase in the variance of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, which has a large impact on the tropical Atlantic via anomalous surface heat fluxes. Winter El Niño (La Niña) affects the eastern equatorial Atlantic by decreasing (increasing) cloud cover and surface wind speed which is associated with anomalous downward (upward) short wave radiation and reduced (enhanced) upward latent heat fluxes, creating anomalous positive (negative) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the region from winter to spring. On the other hand, the decrease of SST variance in autumn is due to a deeper mean thermocline which weakens the impact of the thermocline movement on SST variation. The comparison between the model results and observations is not straightforward owing to the influence of model biases and the lack of a major MOC weakening event in the instrumental record. However, it is argued that the basic physical mechanisms found in the model simulations are likely to be robust and therefore have relevance to understanding tropical Atlantic variability in the real world, perhaps with modified seasonality. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Although latitudinal-shifts in the mean position of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) can explain certain features of the paleo salinity reconstructions, this mechanism does not offer an explanation for the reconstructed basin-wide paleo-salinity response to AMOC change. Here, we present new results from general circulation model simulations that suggest the sea surface salinity (SSS) increase in the tropical north Atlantic during periods of weakened AMOC is mainly controlled by the atmospheric response to the North Atlantic cooling, while the oceanic teleconnection contributes to increased SSS over the equatorial and south tropical Atlantic Ocean.},

   abstract = {To explore the impacts of sea-surface salinity (SSS) on the interannual variability of upper-ocean state, we compare two 10-year runs of an eddy-resolving ocean general circulation model (OGCM): in one, SSS is strongly restored toward a monthly climatology (World Ocean Atlas ’98) and in the other, toward the SSS of a monthly gridded Argo product. The inclusion of the Argo SSS generally improves the interannual variability of the mixed layer depth; particularly so in the western tropical Pacific, where so-called “barrier layers” are reproduced when the Argo SSS is included. The upper-ocean subsurface salinity variability is also improved in the tropics and subtropics even below the mixed layer. To understand the reason for the latter improvement, we separate the salinity difference between the two runs into its “dynamical” and “spiciness” components. The dynamical component is dominated by small-scale noise due to the chaotic nature of mesoscale eddies. The spiciness difference indicates that as expected from the upper-ocean general circulation, SSS variability in the mixed layer is subducted into the thermocline in subtropics; this signal is generally advected downward, equatorward, and westward in the equator-side of the subtropical gyre. The SSS signal subducted in the subtropical North Pacific appears to enter the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Throughflow, although this signal is weak and probably insignificant in our model.},

   abstract = {Sea surface temperature (SST) data from the NOAA OI SST data set for 1982–2011 are used to investigate intraseasonal and interannual variability of Mediterranean SST during winter and summer seasons. It is shown that during winter the intraseasonal SST fluctuations are larger than the interannual SST variations in the western Mediterranean (e.g., the Tyrrhenian Sea), but smaller in the central and eastern Mediterranean Sea. In summer, the intraseasonal SST fluctuations are larger in almost the entire Mediterranean basin. Also summertime intraseasonal SST fluctuations are larger (up to three times near the Gulf of Lions) than their wintertime counterparts in the entire Mediterranean basin. The interannual SST variations are larger during summer in the western and central Mediterranean Sea and during winter in its eastern part. The leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of the Mediterranean SST and of the intensities of its intraseasonal fluctuations are characterized by the differing spatial-temporal structures both during winter and summer implying that their interannual variability is driven by different physical mechanisms. During winter, the EOF-1 of SST is associated with the East Atlantic teleconnection, whereas EOF-1 of the intensity of intraseasonal fluctuations is not linked significantly to regional atmospheric dynamics. The second EOFs of these variables are associated, respectively, with the East Atlantic/West Russia and the North Atlantic teleconnections. While during summer the atmospheric influence on Mediterranean SST is generally weaker, it is revealed that the EOF-1 of the intensity of intraseasonal SST fluctuations is linked to the Polar teleconnection},

New elements include development of an equation for evolution of anomalous SST for interannual and longer time scales in a form analogous to that for OHC, parameterization of the diffusive heat flux at the base of the mixed layer, and analysis of a composite Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) event. Contributions to OHC and SST variability from two sources are evaluated: 1) net ocean–atmosphere heat flux and 2) all other processes, including advection, diffusion, and entrainment for SST. Anomalies in OHC tendency propagate anticlockwise around the SPNA on multidecadal time scales with a clear relationship to the phase of the AMOC. AMOC anomalies lead SST tendencies, which in turn lead OHC tendencies in both the eastern and western SPNA. OHC and SST variations in the SPNA on decadal time scales are dominated by AMOC variability because it controls variability of advection, which is shown to be the dominant term in the OHC budget. Lags between OHC and SST are traced to differences between the advection term for OHC and the advection–entrainment term for SST.

   abstract = {For the past 50 years it has been assumed that the principal pathway for the deep limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC). However, recent observations of Lagrangian floats have shown that the DWBC is not necessarily a unique, dominant, or continuous pathway for these deep waters. A significant portion of the deep water export from the subpolar to the subtropical gyres follows a pathway through the interior of the Newfoundland and subtropical basins, which is constrained by the western boundary and the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The hypothesis that deep eddy-driven recirculation gyres are a mechanism for partitioning the deep limb of the AMOC into the DWBC and this interior pathway is investigated here. Eulerian and Lagrangian analyses of the output of ocean general circulation models at eddy-resolving, eddy-permitting, and non-eddy permitting resolutions are used to test this hypothesis. Eddy-driven recirculation gyres, simulated in the eddy-resolving and eddy-permitting models and similar to recirculations inferred from hydrographic data, are shown to shape the export pathways of deep water from the subpolar to the subtropical gyres. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {As decadal predictions become operational, the need to use, understand, and extract information from them becomes essential. A climate index is a simple diagnostic quantity that can be used to characterize integral aspects of a geophysical system such as circulation patterns, and thus can be used to evaluate decadal forecasts. One of the most studied and well documented regions of the World Ocean is the North Atlantic. The North Atlantic subpolar gyre is an important region for the modulation of European climate and where skillful predictions of up to a decade can be obtained. Ocean re-analysis (ORA-S4) data from 1959 to 2017 are used to introduce a new methodology to compute a climate index of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre that captures both the variability in its strength and shape, the latter was to our knowledge never investigated previously as part of the variability of the gyre on interannual to decadal time scales. The methodology reveals two states of the gyre (before and after 2000), the former is mainly driven by temperature and the latter by a combination of mechanisms that interact to sustain a relatively stable subpolar gyre in terms of strength.},

The sub-polar gyre has contracted and weakened, and changes in circulation pathways have been linked to changes in marine ecosystem productivity. To aid fisheries and environmental scientists, we present here a time series of the Sub-Polar Gyre Index (SPG-I) based on monthly mean maps of sea surface height. The established definition of the SPG-I is applied, and the first EOF (empirical orthogonal function) and PC (principal component) are presented. Sensitivity to the spatial domain and time series length are explored but found not to be important factors in terms of the SPG-I's interpretation. Our time series compares well with indices presented previously.

Recent publications, however, present a more linear version of this index with less of the key interannual-to-decadal variability.

   abstract = {For the period 1826-2000, we analyze the spectral characteristics of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and its predictability based on Singular Spectral Analysis (SSA) and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models. In the first part, SSA is applied to the winter NAO index to isolate its main spectral characteristics. Based on the SSA, a reconstruction (filtering) of the winter NAO index series was carried out. Results of the SSA indicate that the winter NAO index can be broken down into some modulated amplitude oscillations with periods around 7.7 and 4.8 years, some oscillations associated with a broadband peak of period around 2.4 years along with nonlinear trends. The sum of these components, the SSA-filtered series, explains 56% of the variance of the raw winter NAO index. The SSA-filtered series is particularly reliable, reproducing the NAO phase during extreme events (winter NAO index ≥ 1 or ≤ -1) for this subset of events, the phase of the actual and SSA-filtered series shows to be the same in 91% of the cases. The high positive values observed in the winter NAO index in the last eighties and nineties appear to be associated with the simultaneous presence of a positive trend, starting in the early eighties and of unprecedented steepness, and an oscillation with period around 7.7 years, having very high amplitude. In the second part, an ARMA model has been fitted to the filtered winter NAO index and a forecasting experiment was conducted; results are tested against the raw winter NAO index. Results show that the ARMA modeling has useful 1-year-ahead forecasting abilities. Particularly, over the period 1986-2000, not used to fit the model, the model skill is 27.8% better than climatology and 43.3% better than persistence (38:5% and 47.6%, respectively, when taking into account only extreme NAO events). Additionally, percentage of cases in which the NAO phase was accurately predicted proved to be 80% (88% for extreme NAO events). For 2001/2002 and 2002/2003 winters, persistence in the negative phase of the NAO is predicted, having an index value close to -1. Copyright 2002 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {Recent studies on the size and strength of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre (SPG) offer contrasting assessments of the gyre's temporal variability: studies that use empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses of satellite sea-surface height (SSH) report a rapid decline in SPG size and strength since 1992 (∼20% per decade), while concurrent in situ observations report either no trend or a slight decline. Here we investigate this discrepancy by analyzing the size and strength of the SPG with satellite SSH from 1993 to 2015 with two separate methods: indirectly via EOF analysis and more directly through measurements of the gyre center and boundary. We define the boundary of the gyre as the largest closed contour of SSH, the center as the minimum SSH, and the strength as the difference between the SSH at the boundary and the center. We identify a linear decline over the study period in the SPG strength (5.1% per decade), but find no statistically significant trend in the SPG area. The trend in the gyre strength is weaker than the EOF-based trend and is most likely below the level of detection of the in situ measurements. We conclude that the variability previously identified as a sharp decline in SPG circulation can be more appropriately attributed to basin-wide sea level rise during the satellite altimetry period. In addition, we find that the properties of the eastern SPG do not covary with the SPG size, suggesting that SPG dynamics do not control the strength of the intergyre throughput.},

   abstract = {The wintertime NAO is traditionally defined as the first Empirical Orthogonal Function of monthly sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies for all winters and therefore remains fixed in space. The associated NAO index represents the projection of SLP onto the fixed NAO pattern. The NAO index is positive when the pressure contrast between the two centers of action is particularly strong; it is negative when the contrast is weak. This index represents an incomplete description of the wintertime NAO as the pattern is found to shift location on decadal timescales. This study investigates the movement of the centers of action (or nodes) of the NAO for winter in 20-yr running windows starting in 1871. A new climate index, the Angle index, is introduced. It is a measure of the asymmetry in location of the two nodes of the NAO defined in the partially overlapping 20-yr windows. The Angle index has a value of zero only when both nodes are located on the same meridian. It increases in positive value as the curve connecting the nodes tilts more to the northeast; it becomes negative when the tilt is to the northwest. The Angle index complements the smooth NAO index, which is the traditional NAO index averaged over the 20-yr window, especially when the Angle index is strongly negative as occurred during the Arctic warming of the early to mid 20th century. Regression analysis shows that the Angle index provides additional information about climate variability beyond that provided by the smooth NAO index. © 2012. American Geophysical Union.

The helicity of the differential form =dD for the density change in an isentropic and isohaline ascent, relative to the change in the water column, does not vanish since the ratio of the thermal and haline compressibilities is a function of pressure. The form for relative density consequently lacks an integrating denominator and so there are no surfaces of constant relative density, or so-called neutral surfaces (McDougall and Jackett). As a consequence of a remarkable theorem (Carathéodory), any two points in the thermohaline state space or equivalently in the real space of the ocean are mutually accessible, in the sense that they can be joined by a neutral path. Many of the paths between any two points and possibly all may only be piecewise smooth. The theorem is supported here with analytical examples of neutral paths in state space, and a numerical example of an idealized ocean in real space, for all of which the seawater obeys a relatively simple equation of state. The existence of multiple neutral paths for pairs of close points is explicitly demonstrated. Some such neutral paths take large excursions throughout state space and throughout the ocean basin. The implications for hydrography and for ocean modeling are discussed.},

The ocean heat transport is large, about 1.25PW, and on interannual time scales it exhibits surprisingly large temporal variability. There has been a long-term reduction in ocean heat transport of 0.17 PW from 1.32 PW before 2009 to 1.15 PW after 2009 (2009-2016) on an annual average basis associated with a 2.5 Sv drop in the AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation). The reduction in the AMOC has cooled and freshened the upper ocean north of 26°N over an area following the offshore edge of the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Current from the Bahamas to Iceland. Cooling peaks south of Iceland where surface temperatures are as much as 2°C cooler in 2016 than they were in 2008. Heat uptake by the atmosphere appears to have been affected particularly along the path of the North Atlantic Current. For the reduction in ocean heat transport, changes in ocean heat content account for about one-quarter of the long-term reduction in ocean heat transport while reduced heat uptake by the atmosphere appears to account for the remainder of the change in ocean heat transport.},

   abstract = {The north Atlantic subpolar gyre (SPG) has been widely implicated as the source of large-scale changes in the subpolar marine environment. However, inconsistencies between indices of SPG-strength have raised questions about the active role SPG-strength and size play in determining water properties in the eastern subpolar North Atlantic (ENA). Here, by analyzing various SPG indices derived from observations and a global coupled model, we show that the choice of the SPG index dictates the interpretation of SPG strength-salinity relationship in the ENA. Variability in geostrophic currents derived from observed hydrography and model based Lagrangian trajectories reveal zonal shifts of advective pathways in the ENA and meridional shifts in the western intergyre region. Such shifts in advective pathways are manifestations of variability in the size and strength of the SPG, and they impact salinity by modulating the proportion of subpolar and subtropical waters reaching the ENA. SPG indices based on subsurface density and principal component analysis of sea surface height variability capture these shifts in advective pathways, and are therefore best suited to describe SPG-salinity relationship in the ENA. Our results establish the dynamical constraints on the choice of the SPG index and emphasize that SPG indices should be cautiously interpreted.},

OMZs have expanded over the past 50 years, and this expansion is predicted to continue as the climate warms worldwide. Shoaling of the upper boundaries of the OMZs accompanies OMZ expansion, and decreased oxygen at shallower depths can affect all marine organisms through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms. Effects include altered microbial processes that produce and consume key nutrients and gases, changes in predator-prey dynamics, and shifts in the abundance and accessibility of commercially fished species. Although many species will be negatively affected by these effects, others may expand their range or exploit new niches. OMZ shoaling is thus likely to have major and far-reaching consequences.},

We report a decrease in the upper ocean layer exceeding 3.5mll ∼'1 dissolved oxygen at a rate of ≤m Yr -1 in the tropical northeast Atlantic (0-25 °N, 12-30 °W), amounting to an annual habitat loss of ∼1/45.95×10 13 m 3, or 15% for the period 1960-2010.

   abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) can cause devastating impacts to marine life. Despite the serious consequences of MHWs, our understanding of their drivers is largely based on isolated case studies rather than any systematic unifying assessment. Here we provide the first global assessment under a consistent framework by combining a confidence assessment of the historical refereed literature from 1950 to February 2016, together with the analysis of MHWs determined from daily satellite sea surface temperatures from 1982–2016, to identify the important local processes, large-scale climate modes and teleconnections that are associated with MHWs regionally. Clear patterns emerge, including coherent relationships between enhanced or suppressed MHW occurrences with the dominant climate modes across most regions of the globe – an important exception being western boundary current regions where reports of MHW events are few and ocean-climate relationships are complex. These results provide a global baseline for future MHW process and prediction studies.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {The strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) at 26° N has now been continuously measured by the RAPID array over the period April 2004-September 2018. This record provides unique insight into the variability of the large-scale ocean circulation, previously only measured by sporadic snapshots of basin-wide transport from hydrographic sections. The continuous measurements have unveiled striking variability on timescales of days to a decade, driven largely by wind forcing, contrasting with previous expectations about a slowly varying buoyancy-forced large-scale ocean circulation. However, these measurements were primarily observed during a warm state of the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) which has been steadily declining since a peak in 2008-2010. In 2013-2015, a period of strong buoyancy forcing by the atmosphere drove intense water-mass transformation in the subpolar North Atlantic and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the response of the large-scale ocean circulation to buoyancy forcing. Modelling studies suggest that the AMOC in the subtropics responds to such events with an increase in overturning transport, after a lag of 3-9 years. At 45° N, observations suggest that the AMOC may already be increasing. Examining 26° N, we find that the AMOC is no longer weakening, though the recent transport is not above the long-term mean. Extending the record backwards in time at 26° N with ocean reanalysis from GloSea5, the transport fluctuations at 26° N are consistent with a 0-to 2-year lag from those at 45° N, albeit with lower magnitude. Given the short span of time and anticipated delays in the signal from the subpolar to subtropical gyres, it is not yet possible to determine whether the subtropical AMOC strength is recovering nor how the AMOC at 26° N responds to intense buoyancy forcing.},

A photovoltaic system is needed in order to use this energy continuously. The results of the investigation of components, design, and market availability are shown in the paper. Solar cells, which are used for absorbing sunlight and generating electric current, are the main source for the system’s operation. A charge controller is used to control the flow of charge through the battery and to protect the battery from overcharging and deep discharging. A dc-dc converter is used to regulate the output voltage which depends on the type of dc to dc converter. Lead acid batteries are used as the electric energy storage for the PV system to use electrical energy in the absence of sunlight. The principle operation of the system and the feasibility of using it for rural area with no power grid have been studied. For this project, a mount tracker was constructed that enabled the solar panel to be placed at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 degree angles in order to determine which angle and what time provides the optimum voltage. Experimental results for different angles of radiation at different times of the day and different days of the year are shown in the paper.},

The positive phase of the SAM is also associated with anomalously dry conditions over southern South America, New Zealand and Tasmania, due to the southward shift of the stormtrack; and to anomalously wet conditions over much of Australia and South Africa.

This variability in the polar jet drives large fluctuations in the Southern Hemisphere climate, from the lower stratosphere into the troposphere, and stretching from the midlatitudes across the Southern Ocean to Antarctica. Notably, the SAM index has displayed marked positive trends in the austral summer season (stronger and poleward shifted westerlies), associated with stratospheric ozone loss. Historical reconstructions demonstrate that these recent positive SAM index values are unprecedented in the last millennia, and fall outside the range of natural climate variability. Despite these advances in the understanding of the SAM behavior, several areas of active research are identified that highlight gaps in our present knowledge.

   abstract = {The air-sea fluxes of momentum, heat, freshwater and their components have been computed globally from 1948 at frequencies ranging from 6-hourly to monthly. All fluxes are computed over the 23 years from 1984 to 2006, but radiation prior to 1984 and precipitation before 1979 are given only as climatological mean annual cycles. The input data are based on NCEP reanalysis only for the near surface vector wind, temperature, specific humidity and density, and on a variety of satellite based radiation, sea surface temperature, sea-ice concentration and precipitation products. Some of these data are adjusted to agree in the mean with a variety of more reliable satellite and in situ measurements, that themselves are either too short a duration, or too regional in coverage. The major adjustments are a general increase in wind speed, decrease in humidity and reduction in tropical solar radiation. The climatological global mean air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes (1984-2006) then become 2 W/m2 and -0.1 mg/m2 per second, respectively, down from 30 W/m2 and 3.4 mg/m2 per second for the unaltered data. However, decadal means vary from 7.3 W/m2 (1977-1986) to -0.3 W/m2 (1997-2006). The spatial distributions of climatological fluxes display all the expected features. A comparison of zonally averaged wind stress components across ocean sub-basins reveals large differences between available products due both to winds and to the stress calculation. Regional comparisons of the heat and freshwater fluxes reveal an alarming range among alternatives; typically 40 W/m2 and 10 mg/m2 per second, respectively. The implied ocean heat transports are within the uncertainty of estimates from ocean observations in both the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific basins. They show about 2.4 PW of tropical heating, of which 80% is transported to the north, mostly in the Atlantic. There is similar good agreement in freshwater transport at many latitudes in both basins, but neither in the South Atlantic, nor at 35°N. © Springer-Verlag 2008.},

Simulated transports of the EUC that supplies the annual mean upwelling in the central and eastern equatorial Atlantic are in good agreement with new transport estimates derived from ship observations, i.e., 19.9 and 14.O Sv at 35°W and 23°W, respectively. Although the observations are not conclusive concerning the seasonal cycle of EUC transports, the simulated seasonal cycles fit largely in the observed range. The analysis of the EUC variability associated with interannual boreal summer variability of the equatorial cold tongue showed that cold tongue indices, defined either by near-surface temperature or steric height anomalies, are anticorrelated with thermocline EUC transports anomalies: A strong EUC corresponds to low near-surface temperatures and steric heights. The importance of equatorial waves for the cold tongue region is shown: Surface layer transport anomalies at 23°W and 10°W are significantly correlated with both near-surface temperature and steric height anomalies in the equatorial and coastal upwelling regions, indicating an associated eastward phase propagation along the equator toward the African coast where the signal bifurcates into two poleward branches along the coast and is reflected into a westward propagating wave.

The AMOC plays an important role in transporting heat meridionally in the climate system. Observations suggest a heat transport by the AMOC of 1.3 PW at 26°N—a latitude which is close to where the Atlantic northward heat transport is thought to reach its maximum. This shapes the climate of the North Atlantic region as we know it today. In recent years there has been significant progress both in our ability to observe the AMOC in nature and to simulate it in numerical models. Most previous modeling investigations of the AMOC and its impact on climate have relied on models with horizontal resolution that does not resolve ocean mesoscale eddies and the dynamics of the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Current system. As a result of recent increases in computing power, models are now being run that are able to represent mesoscale ocean dynamics and the circulation features that rely on them. The aim of this review is to describe new insights into the AMOC provided by high-resolution models. Furthermore, we will describe how high-resolution model simulations can help resolve outstanding challenges in our understanding of the AMOC.},

This poleward heat transport has been implicated as one possible cause of the declining sea-ice extent and increasing ocean temperatures across the Nordic Seas and the Arctic Ocean, but robust estimates are still lacking. Here, we use a box inverse model and more than 20 years of volume transport measurements to show that the mean ocean heat transport was 305 ± 26 TW for 1993–2016. A significant increase of 21 TW occurred after 2001, which is sufficient to account for the recent accumulation of heat in the northern seas. Ocean heat transport may therefore have been a major contributor to climate change since the late 1990s. This increased heat transport contrasts with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) slowdown at mid-latitudes and indicates a discontinuity of the overturning circulation measured at different latitudes in the Atlantic Ocean.},

   abstract = {<p> The North Atlantic Current is the major pathway for warm and saline water from the subtropics into the subpolar North Atlantic. Its main branch crosses 47°/48°N in the western North Atlantic basin and further north the Mid‐Atlantic Ridge (MAR) before entering the eastern subpolar basin where it partly feeds the subpolar gyre. To quantify the meridional exchange of water between the subtropical and subpolar regime in the interior eastern North Atlantic, long‐term (1993–2017) transport time series were calculated by combining data from inverted echo sounders taken in 2016–2017 with the dynamic topography from satellite altimetry. The data reveal an additional more direct pathway from the south across 47°/48°N with a mean northward transport of 9.1 Sv ± 0.8 Sv contributing about 22% to the total inflow of 41.4 Sv into the eastern subpolar basin. The transport time series of this pathway is significantly anticorrelated to the zonal transport across the MAR ( <italic>R</italic>  = −0.7), damping the interannual variability of the total transport into the subpolar eastern North Atlantic. Moreover, for the meridional transport in the interior eastern basin, a positive trend of 2.0 Sv ± 1.5 Sv per decade is found, partly balancing the negative decadal trend of −6.0 Sv ± 5.7 Sv observed in the interior western basin. </p>},

   abstract = {AbstractMajor marine heatwave (MHW) events have caused catastrophic impacts on coastal marine ecosystems. However, to date there has not been a global assessment of MHWs in coastal areas where rich marine ecosystems are at risk. Here, we combine four satellite SST products to quantify the distribution, characteristics, and decadal trend of coastal MHWs, using an ensemble approach. Hotspots of MHW stress, defined as yearly cumulative intensity, were found to be concentrated in mid latitude coasts like the Mediterranean Sea, Japan Sea, and Tasman Sea, as well as the north-eastern coast of the United States. We found a global increase in coastal MHW frequency and duration during the past 25 years by 1-2 events per decade and 5-10 days per decade, respectively, with regional distribution closely related to decadal climate variability. Increases in frequency and duration of MHWs has led to large increases of cumulative intensity and yearly cumulative intensity, particularly in mid-latitudes and hotspot regions. Long-term changes in mean SST were the main driver of the observed trends of coastal MHWs, while internal variability was important for explaining local decreases in MHW metrics such as along the south-eastern Pacific coast. MHW average metrics and trends were consistent across all four products used in this analysis, giving high confidence in the results. However, important differences between products were observed for MHW mean intensity, which was well correlated to SST variability, suggesting sensitivity of this metric to the specific SST dataset and demonstrating a need for an ensemble approach to MHW analysis.},

   abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are becoming more common with record events occurring around the world and unprecedented biological impacts including mass mortality and habitat shifts. However, little is known about the statistical characteristics of MHWs due to the lack of long-term in situ observations. Using two historical data sets spanning from 1953 (and 1992) to 2016, we use a seasonally varying climatology and temperature anomalies to identify and characterize MHW events down to 100 m depth in coastal waters off southeastern Australia. We show that MHWs regularly extend the full depth of the water column, with a maximum intensity below the surface. Extreme temperatures at depth are driven by local downwelling favorable winds that mix the water column and reduce the stratification. These results show the importance of considering subsurface hydrography and that sea surface temperature is insufficient to fully understand MHWs which are having disastrous ecological consequences in coastal regions globally.},

   abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs), or prolonged periods of anomalously warm sea water temperature, have been increasing in duration and intensity globally for decades. However, there are many coastal, oceanic, polar, and sub-surface regions where our ability to detect MHWs is uncertain due to limited high quality data. Here, we investigate the effect that short time series length, missing data, or linear long-term temperature trends may have on the detection of MHWs. We show that MHWs detected in time series as short as 10 years did not have durations or intensities appreciably different from events detected in a standard 30 year long time series. We also show that the output of our MHW algorithm for time series missing less than 25% data did not differ appreciably from a complete time series, and that the level of allowable missing data could cautiously be increased to 50% when gaps were filled by linear interpolation. Finally, linear long-term trends of 0.10°C/decade or greater added to a time series caused larger changes (increases) to the count and duration of detected MHWs than shortening a time series to 10 years or missing more than 25% of the data. The long-term trend in a time series has the largest effect on the detection of MHWs and has the largest range in added uncertainty in the results. Time series length has less of an effect on MHW detection than missing data, but adds a larger range of uncertainty to the results. We provide suggestions for best practices to improve the accuracy of MHW detection with sub-optimal time series and show how the accuracy of these corrections may change regionally.},

This paper examines the intensity, duration, and frequency of positive sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans over the period 1950–2014 using an objective definition for marine heatwaves based on their probability of occurrence. Small-area anomalies occur more frequently than large-area anomalies, and this relationship can be characterized by a power law distribution. The relative frequency of large- versus small-area anomalies, represented by the power law slope parameter, is modulated by basin-scale modes of natural climate variability and anthropogenic warming. Findings suggest that the probability of marine heatwaves is a trade-off between size, intensity, and duration and that region specific variability modulates the frequency of these events},

Here, we study the large-scale spreading of South Atlantic Water (SAW) into the western tropical North Atlantic from the equator to 25°N. The fractions of SAW in the upper ocean water masses are quantified using a water mass analysis applied on a data set of conductivity-temperature- depth data from the Hydrobase project and the Argo float program. To fill gaps in the data coverage and to gain insight into the mechanisms involved, the observations are complemented with results from the high-resolution Family of Linked Atlantic Model Experiments model (1/12°), which has been shown to realistically simulate the inflow of SAW into the Caribbean. The analysis reveals the mean SAW propagation pathways in the North Atlantic and identifies the regions of largest variability. High SAW fractions in the thermocline and central water layers are limited to the region south of 10°N, where the water body consists of 80%-90% SAW. Thus, the zonal currents in the equatorial gyre are mainly formed of SAW. The weaker currents in the intermediate layer combined with a northward excursion of the North Equatorial Current allow the SAW in this layer to intrude farther north compared to the layers above. The transition into North Atlantic Water occurs gradually from 12°N to 20°N in the intermediate layer. Copyright © 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {Data from a hydrographic section carried out in January-March 1994 offshore from the eastern coast of South America from 50S to 10N, are used to quantify the full-depth exchanges of water between the western boundary currents and the ocean interior. In the upper and intermediate layers, the westward transport associated with the southern branch of the South Equatorial Current was 49 Sv at the time of the cruise. The transports of the central and northern branches in the upper 200 m were 17 Sv and 12 Sv, respectively. After subtraction of the parts that recirculate in the subtropical, subequatorial, and equatorial domains, the fraction of the South Equatorial Current that effectively contributes to the warm water export to the North Atlantic is estimated at 18 Sv. The poleward boundary of the current southern branch is at 31S through the whole thickness of the subtropical gyre, but the latitude of the northern boundary varies from 7°30'S at the surface to 27S at 1400 m depth. The estimated latitude of its bifurcation into the Brazil Current and North Brazil Undercurrent also varies downward from about 14S at the surface to 28S at a depth of 600 m. In the North Atlantic Deep Water, eastward flows exceeding 10 Sv are observed at 3°-4° of latitude in both hemispheres, at 10S, and at 34S-30S. Between 4S and 17S, a net westward flow with an estimated transport of 19 Sv reinforces the southward deep western boundary current. Cyclonic circulations of Antarctic Bottom Water along the western boundaries of the Argentine and Brazil basins have amplitudes of 15 Sv and 13 Sv, respectively, exceeding those of the interbasin exchanges. The net alongshore transport of this water mass between the hydrographic section and the continental slope reverses to a southward direction from 13S to 27S, probably in relation with an eastward shift of the equatorward near-bottom boundary current at these latitudes.},

SASA is zonally wider in winter and retracted to the east in summer, when it presents a more circular format. These features of the SASA in the present climate (1979–2005) are well represented by the three global climate models, which also project this same SASA seasonal pattern for the future climate (2065–2095). Considering the projections, they indicate a slightly poleward expansion of the SASA, which is associated with the widening of the Hadley cell. At the SASA core, the pressure can be similar or slightly more intense than the present climate.},

Although various potential drivers have been suggested to explain the LIA cooling, no coherent mechanism has yet been proposed for this seasonal contrast. Here we demonstrate that such exceptional wintertime conditions arose from sea ice expansion and reduced ocean heat losses in the Nordic and Barents seas, driven by a multicentennial reduction in the northward heat transport by the subpolar gyre (SPG). However, these anomalous oceanic conditions were largely decoupled from the European atmospheric variability in summer. Our novel dynamical explanation is derived from analysis of an ensemble of last millennium climate simulations, and is supported by reconstructions of European temperatures and atmospheric circulation variability and North Atlantic/Arctic paleoceanographic conditions. We conclude that SPG-related internal climate feedbacks were responsible for the winter amplification of the European LIA cooling. Thus, characterization of SPG dynamics is essential for understanding multicentennial variations of the seasonal cycle in the European/North Atlantic sector.},

Here, we show that this surface anticyclone is the imprint of a deep, persistent, non-stationary anticyclonic vortex. Using wintertime 2007 and 2011 ship-board data, we describe the anticyclone's vertical structure for the first time and find that the anticyclone core is partly made of warm and salty Mediterranean Overflow Water. The anticyclone has a radius of ~40 km, it stretches down to 2,000 m, with a velocity maximum around 500 m. To analyze the anticyclone's generating mechanism, we use a mesoscale-resolving (~2 km) simulation, which produces a realistic pattern of the Rockall Trough anticyclone. The simulation indicates that the anticyclone is locally formed and sustained by two types of processes: wintertime convection and merger with anticyclonic vortices shed from the slope current flowing poleward along the eastern Rockall Trough slope. Intense negative vorticity filaments are generated along the Rockall Trough south-eastern slope, and they encapsulate Mediterranean Overflow Water as they detach and grow into anticyclonic vortices. These Mediterranean Overflow Water-rich vortices are advected into the trough, consequently merging with the Rockall Trough anticyclone and sustaining it. We suggest that the Rockall Trough anticyclone impacts regional intermediate water masses modifications, heat and salt budgets locally, and further afield into the neighboring subpolar northeast North Atlantic.},

Annual mean meridional velocity averaged within a 2° longitude band off the South American coast shows that the SEC bifurcation occurs at about 10°-14°S near the surface, shifting poleward with increasing depth, reaching 27°S at 1000 m, in both observations and model. The bifurcation latitude reaches its southernmost position in July (∼17°S in the top 200 m) and its northernmost position in November (∼13°S in the top 200 m). The model results show that most of the seasonal variability of the bifurcation latitude in the upper thermocline is associated with changes in the local wind stress curl due to the annual north-south excursion of the marine ITCZ complex. As the SEC bifurcation latitude moves south (north) the NBUC transport increases (decreases) and the BC transport decreases (increases). The remote forcing (i.e., westward propagation of anomalies) appears to have a smaller impact on the seasonal variability of the bifurcation in the upper thermocline. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia 'Ningaloo Niño' in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a specific quantitative definition for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our understanding of these phenomena.},

Mean profiles of zonal velocity measured by moored acoustic Doppler current profilers yielded a westward flowing Equatorial Intermediate Current (EIC) below the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) at both locations. The EIC consists of two westward current cores at about 250 and 450 m. The upper core of the EIC deepens by about 30 m from 23°W, where it has a mean velocity of 6 ± 2 cm s-1, to 35°W, where the mean is 5 ± 3 cm s-1. The lower core of the EIC is about twice as strong with 12 ± 1 cm s-1 at 23°W and 9 ± 2 cm s-1 at 35°W. The flow below the EUC is characterized by substantial interannual variability. From May to December 2005 a strong, zonally coherent eastward jet occurred at 300 to 350 m depth, found to be an expression of shallow stacked jets superimposed on the mean EIC. Shipboard hydrographic observations in June-July 2006 revealed the existence of a high-oxygen tongue that can be traced from 35°W to 10°W in the depth range of the eastward jet prevailing during the preceding year. On the basis of an advection-diffusion balance, it is suggested that the oxygen decrease from 35°W to 10°W within the oxygen tongue is mainly balanced by lateral eddy diffusivity and oxygen consumption, with diapycnal turbulent diffusivity playing only a minor role.

   abstract = {Hydrographic data from full-depth moorings maintained by the Rapid/-MOCHA project and spanning the Atlantic at 26 N are decomposed into vertical modes in order to give a dynamical framework for interpreting the observed fluctuations. Vertical modes at each mooring are fit to pressure perturbations using a Gauss-Markov inversion. Away from boundaries, the vertical structure is almost entirely described by the first baroclinic mode, as confirmed by high correlation between the original signal and reconstructions using only the first baroclinic mode. These first baroclinic motions are also highly coherent with altimetric sea surface height (SSH). Within a Rossby radius (45 km) of the western and eastern boundaries, however, the decomposition contains significant variance at higher modes, and there is a corresponding decrease in the agreement between SSH and either the original signal or the first baroclinic mode reconstruction. Compared to the full transport signal, transport fluctuations described by the first baroclinic mode represent <25 km of the variance within 10 km of the western boundary, in contrast to 60 km at other locations. This decrease occurs within a Rossby radius of the western boundary. At the eastern boundary, a linear combination of many baroclinic modes is required to explain the observed vertical density profile of the seasonal cycle, a result that is consistent with an oceanic response to wind-forcing being trapped to the eastern boundary.},

It is concluded that the methods used in these earlier estimates yield values that are biased systematically low by 5%-15% owing to seemingly minor computational errors. Geographical variations in the new high-resolution maps of c1 and γ1 are discussed in terms of a WKB approximation that elucidates the effects of earth rotation, stratification, and water depth on these quantities.

   abstract = { Sea surface salinity patterns have intensified between the mid-20 th century and present day, with saline areas becoming saltier and fresher areas fresher. This change has been linked to a human-induced strengthening of the global hydrological cycle as global mean surface temperatures rose. Here we analyse salinity observations from the round-the-world voyages of HMS Challenger and SMS Gazelle in the 1870s, early in the industrial era, to reconstruct surface salinity changes since that decade. We find that the amplification of the salinity change pattern between the 1870s and the 1950s was at a rate that was 54 ± 10% lower than the post-1950s rate. The acceleration in salinity pattern amplification over almost 150 years implies that the hydrological cycle would have similarly accelerated over this period. },

   abstract = {The equatorial deep jets (EDJs) are a ubiquitous feature of the equatorial oceans; in the Atlantic Ocean, they are the dominant mode of interannual variability of the zonal flow at intermediate depth. On the basis of more than 10 years of moored observations of zonal velocity at 23°W, the vertically propagating EDJs are best described as superimposed oscillations of the 13th to the 23rd baroclinic modes with a dominant oscillation period for all modes of 1650 days. This period is close to the resonance period of the respective gravest equatorial basin mode for the dominant vertical modes 16 and 17. It is argued that since the equatorial basin mode is composed of linear equatorial waves, a linear reduced-gravity model can be employed for each baroclinic mode, driven by spatially homogeneous zonal forcing oscillating with the EDJ period. The fit of the model solutions to observations at 23°W yields a basinwide reconstruction of the EDJs and the associated vertical structure of their forcing. From the resulting vertical profile of mean power input and vertical energy flux on the equator, it follows that the EDJs are locally maintained over a considerable depth range, from 500 to 2500 m, with the maximum power input and vertical energy flux at 1300 m. The strong dissipation closely ties the apparent vertical propagation of energy to the vertical distribution of power input and, together with the EDJs' prevailing downward phase propagation, requires the phase of the forcing of the EDJs to propagate downward.},

   abstract = {The tropical oceans have long been recognized as the most important region for large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions, giving rise to coupled climate variations on several time scales. During the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) decade, the focus of much tropical ocean research was on understanding El Niño-related processes and on development of tropical ocean models capable of simulating and predicting El Niño. These studies led to an appreciation of the vital role the ocean plays in providing the memory for predicting El Niño and thus making seasonal climate prediction feasible. With the end of TOGA and the beginning of Climate Variability and Prediction (CLIVAR), the scope of climate variability and predictability studies has expanded from the tropical Pacific and ENSO-centric basis to the global domain. In this paper the progress that has been made in tropical ocean climate studies during the early years of CLIVAR is discussed. The discussion is divided geographically into three tropical ocean basins with an emphasis on the dynamical processes that are most relevant to the coupling between the atmosphere and oceans. For the tropical Pacific, the continuing effort to improve understanding of large- and small-scale dynamics for the purpose of extending the skill of ENSO prediction is assessed. This paper then goes beyond the time and space scales of El Niño and discusses recent research activities on the fundamental issue of the processes maintaining the tropical thermocline. This includes the study of subtropical cells (STCs) and ventilated thermocline processes, which are potentially important to the understanding of the low-frequency modulation of El Niño. For the tropical Atlantic, the dominant oceanic processes that interact with regional atmospheric feedbacks are examined as well as the remote influence from both the Pacific El Niño and extratropical climate fluctuations giving rise to multiple patterns of variability distinguished by season and location. The potential impact of Atlantic thermohaline circulation on tropical Atlantic variability (TAV) is also discussed. For the tropical Indian Ocean, local and remote mechanisms governing low-frequency sea surface temperature variations are examined. After annoteing the recent rapid progress in the understanding of coupled dynamics in the region, this study focuses on the active role of ocean dynamics in a seasonally locked east-west internal mode of variability, known as the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD). Influences of the IOD on climatic conditions in Asia, Australia, East Africa, and Europe are discussed. While the attempt throughout is to give a comprehensive overview of what is known about the role of the tropical oceans in climate, the fact of the matter is that much remains to be understood and explained. The complex nature of the tropical coupled phenomena and the interaction among them argue strongly for coordinated and sustained observations, as well as additional careful modeling investigations in order to further advance the current understanding of the role of tropical oceans in climate.},

   abstract = {The tropical Atlantic upper-ocean circulation experiences multiannual to decadal changes associated with different climate modes and is simultaneously adjusting to climate warming. The most energetic current in the tropical Atlantic is the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), which flows eastwards along the Equator. On the basis of long-term moored observations, we show that the EUC strengthened by more than 20% from 2008 to 2018. The intensification of the EUC is associated with increasing subsurface oxygen concentrations and a thickening of the upper-ocean oxygenated layer in the equatorial Atlantic. These changes counteract climate-warming-induced deoxygenation in the region. The EUC strengthening is found to be mainly forced by trade wind changes in the western tropical North Atlantic. A 60-yr dataset reveals that the recent oxygen increase in the upper equatorial Atlantic is associated with multidecadal variability. This variability is characterized by low oxygen concentrations in the 1990s and early 2000s, and high oxygen concentrations in the 1960s and 1970s. The observed oxygen variability seems to be linked to a compression and expansion of the habitat of tropical pelagic fish, and must be accounted for when evaluating the possible consequences of deoxygenation for marine ecosystems and fisheries.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {Bottom pressure observations on both sides of the Atlantic basin, combined with satellite measurements of sea level anomalies and wind stress data, are utilized to estimate variations of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) at 11? S. Over the period 2013 2018, the AMOC and its components are dominated by seasonal variability, with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 12 Sv for the upper-ocean geostrophic transport, 7 Sv for the Ekman and 14 Sv for the AMOC transport. The characteristics of the observed seasonal cycles of the AMOC and its components are compared to results from an ocean general circulation model, which is known to reproduce the variability of the Western Boundary Current on longer timescales. The observed seasonal variability of zonally integrated geostrophic velocity in the upper 300 m is controlled by pressure variations at the eastern boundary, while at 500 m depth contributions from the western and eastern boundaries are similar. The model tends to underestimate the seasonal pressure variability at 300 and 500 m depth, especially at the western boundary, which translates into the estimate of the upper-ocean geostrophic transport. In the model, seasonal AMOC variability at 11? S is governed, besides the Ekman transport, by the geostrophic transport variability in the eastern basin. The geostrophic contribution of the western basin to the seasonal cycle of the AMOC is instead comparably weak, as transport variability in the western basin interior related to local wind curl forcing is mainly compensated by the Western Boundary Current. Our analyses indicate that while some of the uncertainties of our estimates result from the technical aspects of the observational strategy or processes not being properly represented in the model, uncertainties in the wind forcing are particularly relevant for the resulting uncertainties of AMOC estimates at 11<S.},

One of these tools is Lagrangian ocean analysis, where a set of virtual particles is released and their dynamics are integrated in time based on fields defining the ocean state, including the hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry if available. This popular methodology needs to adapt to the large variety of models producing these fields at different formats. This is precisely the aim of Parcels, a Lagrangian ocean analysis framework designed to combine (1) a wide flexibility to model particles of different natures and (2) an efficient implementation in accordance with modern computing infrastructure. In the new Parcels v2.0, we implement a set of interpolation schemes to read various types of discretized fields, from rectilinear to curvilinear grids in the horizontal direction, from z to s levels in the vertical direction and using grid staggering with the Arakawa A, B and C grids. In particular, we develop a new interpolation scheme for a threedimensional curvilinear C grid and analyse its properties. Parcels v2.0 capabilities, including a suite of meta-field objects, are then illustrated in a brief study of the distribution of floating microplastic in the northwest European continental shelf and its sensitivity to various physical processes.},

The characteristics and distributions of water masses in biogeochemical space are useful for, in particular, chemical and biological oceanography to understand the origin and mixing history of water samples. Here, we define the characteristics of the major water masses in the Atlantic Ocean as source water types (SWTs) from their formation areas, and map out their distributions. The SWTs are described by six properties taken from the biased-adjusted Global Ocean Data Analysis Project version 2 (GLODAPv2) data product, including both conservative (conservative temperature and absolute salinity) and non-conservative (oxygen, silicate, phosphate and nitrate) properties. The distributions of these water masses are investigated with the use of the optimum multi-parameter (OMP) method and mapped out. The Atlantic Ocean is divided into four vertical layers by distinct neutral densities and four zonal layers to guide the identification and characterization. The water masses in the upper layer originate from wintertime subduction and are defined as central waters. Below the upper layer, the intermediate layer consists of three main water masses: Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), Subarctic Intermediate Water (SAIW) and Mediterranean Water (MW). The North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW, divided into its upper and lower components) is the dominating water mass in the deep and overflow layer. The origin of both the upper and lower NADW is the Labrador Sea Water (LSW), the Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) and the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW). The Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is the only natural water mass in the bottom layer, and this water mass is redefined as Northeast Atlantic Bottom Water (NEABW) in the north of the Equator due to the change of key properties, especially silicate. Similar with NADW, two additional water masses, Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) and Weddell Sea Bottom Water (WSBW), are defined in the Weddell Sea region in order to understand the origin of AABW.},

The in situ data are used to describe the distribution at intermediate levels of Sub-Arctic Intermediate Water (SAIW) and Mediterranean Water (MW), as well as the temporal variability in the presence of these two water masses. Salty, MW-influenced water was found in the southeastern part of the study area, near the continental slope as far north as Porcupine Bank, consistent with earlier reports. Apart from the main tongue, the distribution of MW is patchy, and MW parcels were found not only adjacent to the slope but also offshore. Further north and west, water at intermediate depths was influenced by the fresher SAIW. Unlike in some earlier studies, SAIW did not extend as far east as the continental shelf. The year-long hydrographic and current time series from a mooring on the western slope of the entrance, at the southern end of Feni Ridge, showed pulses of SAIW influenced water throughout winter and spring. In late spring, the fresh pulses almost completely ceased; throughout summer only a few weak and shortlived fresh anomalies appeared. The weakening of the SAIW signal did not seem to be caused by winter convection, which did not extend to sufficient depth that winter. The relatively weak SAIW presence during most of the study period may be linked to the near neutral state of the NAO index. The warm and saline conditions observed at the southern entrance to Rockall Trough were in agreement with the rising temperatures and salinities found over large parts of the subpolar North Atlantic in the late 1990s and early 2000s. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of the 40-year Extended Ellett Line record shows proportions of Norwegian Sea Deep Water associated with the deep core exceed 15% around one quarter of the time. We present the first transport estimates for overflow water in the Rockall Trough. This flux is for overflow water modified by mixing with a density greater than 27.65 kg m−3. Mean values calculated both from a newly deployed mooring array (OSNAP project) and indirectly from the Extended Ellett Line time-series are −0.3±0.04 Sv. Although the flux is highly variable there is no long term trend. As some overflow appears to exit into the Iceland Basin via channels between the northern banks, we suggest that the volume transport will likely increase as the flow pathway is traced back around the boundary of the Rockall Trough towards the Wyville Thomson Ridge.},

   abstract = {Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) is a dominant Southern Hemisphere water mass that spreads from its formation regions just north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) to at least 20°S in all oceans. This study uses an isopycnal climatology constructed from Argo conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) profile data to define the current state of the AAIW salinity minimum (its core) and thence compute anomalies of AAIW core pressure, potential temperature, salinity, and potential density since the mid-1970s from ship-based CTD profiles. The results are used to calculate maps of temporal property trends at the AAIW core, where statistically significant strong circumpolar shoaling (30–50 dbar decade−1), warming (0.05°–0.15°C decade−1), and density reductions [up to −0.03 (kg m−3) decade−1] are found. These trends are strongest just north of the ACC in the southeast Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and decrease equatorward. Salinity trends are generally small, with their sign varying regionally. Bottle data are used to extend the AAIW core potential temperature anomaly analysis back to 1925 in the Atlantic and to ~1960 elsewhere. The modern warm AAIW core conditions appear largely unprecedented in the historical record: biennially and zonally binned median AAIW core potential temperatures within each ocean basin are, with the notable exception of the subtropical South Atlantic in the 1950s–70s, 0.2–1°C colder than modern values. Zonally averaged sea surface temperature anomalies around the AAIW formation latitudes in each ocean and sectoral southern annular mode indices are used to put the AAIW core property trends and variations into context.},

   abstract = {One of the commonly used tools for detecting changes in climatic and hydrologic time series is trend analysis. A number of statistical tests exist to assess the significance of trends in time series. One of the commonly used non-parametric trend tests is the Mann-Kendall trend test. The null hypothesis in the Mann-Kendall test is that the data are independent and randomly ordered. However, the existence of positive autocorrelation in the data increases the probability of detecting trends when actually none exist, and vice versa. Although this is a well-known fact, few studies have addressed this issue, and autocorrelation in the data is often ignored. In this study, the effect of autocorrelation on the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test statistic is discussed. A theoretical relationship is derived to calculate the variance of the Mann-Kendall test statistic for autocorrelated data. The special cases of AR(1) and MA(1) dependence are discussed as examples. An approximation to the theoretical relationship is also presented in order to reduce computation time for long time series. Based on the modified value of the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test statistic, a modified non-parametric trend test which is suitable for autocorrelated data is proposed. The accuracy of the modified test in terms of its empirical significance level was found to be superior to that of the original Mann-Kendall trend test without any loss of power. The modified test is applied to rainfall as well as streamflow data to demonstrate its performance as compared to the original Mann-Kendall trend test.},

   abstract = {The sensitivity of a global thermodynamic-dynamic sea ice model coupled to a one-dimensional upper ocean model to degradations of the model physics is investigated. The thermodynamic component of the sea ice model takes into consideration the presence of snow on top of sea ice, the storage of sensible and latent heat inside the snow-ice system, the influence of the subgrid-scale snow and ice thickness distributions on sea ice thermodynamics, the transformation of snow into snow ice when snow depth increases to the point where the snow-ice interface sinks below the waterline, and the existence of leads and polynyas (areas of open water) within the ice cover. Ice dynamics is treated basically as by Hibler [1979]. Regarding the upper ocean model, it is made up of an integral mixed layer model and of a diffusive model of the pycnocline. Advection of heat and salt by oceanic currents is implicitly accounted for by restoring the temperatures and salinities of the water column to annual mean data. It is very important to note that a single set of parameter values is employed to simultaneously simulate the Arctic and Antarctic ice regimes. A control run carried out with the model demonstrates that it does reasonably well in simulating the seasonal waxing and waning of both ice packs. The sensitivity study focuses on physical processes pertaining to (1) the vertical growth and decay of sea ice (thermal inertia of snow and ice, heat conduction, and snow cover), (2) the lateral growth and decay of sea ice (leads and polynyas), and (3) the sea ice dynamics (ice motion and shear strength). A total of nine sensitivity experiments have been performed. Each experiment consisted of removing a particular parameterization from the control run computer code. It appears that the thermal inertia of the snow-ice system is negligible in the Antarctic but not in the Arctic, where the total heat content of sea ice is chiefly dictated by internal storage of latent heat in brine pockets, sensible heat storage being of very minor consequence. It is also found that the inclusion of a prognostic snow layer and of a scheme of snow ice formation is important for sea ice modeling in the southern hemisphere. Furthermore, our results suggest that the thermodynamic effect of the subgrid-scale snow and ice thickness distributions, the existence of open water areas within the ice cover, and the ice motion play a crucial role in determining the seasonal behavior of both ice packs. The ice shear strength seems to be of lesser importance, although it has a nonnegligible effect in both hemispheres. We can therefore conclude that all these processes should be represented in global climate models.},

The package first provides model-independent Fortran90 procedures containing the different operations in an AMR process: time integration of grid hierarchy, clustering, interpolations, updates, etc. The package then creates the Fortran90 model-dependent part of the code based on an entry file written by the user. The basic idea of AGRIF is to make use of Fortran90 pointers to successively address the variables of the different grids of an AMR process. As pointers can be used exactly like other (static) variables in Fortran, most of the original code will remain unchanged. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Improvements in the horizontal resolution of global ocean models, motivated by the horizontal resolution requirements for specific flow features, has advanced modelling capabilities into the dynamical regime dominated by mesoscale variability. In contrast, the choice of the vertical grid remains a subjective choice, and it is not clear that efforts to improve vertical resolution adequately support their horizontal counterparts. Indeed, considering that the bulk of the vertical ocean dynamics (including convection) are parameterized, it is not immediately obvious what the vertical grid is supposed to resolve. Here, we propose that the primary purpose of the vertical grid in a hydrostatic ocean model is to resolve the vertical structure of horizontal flows, rather than to resolve vertical motion. With this principle we construct vertical grids based on their abilities to represent baroclinic modal structures commensurate with the theoretical capabilities of a given horizontal grid. This approach is designed to ensure that the vertical grids of global ocean models complement (and, importantly, to not undermine) the resolution capabilities of the horizontal grid. We find that for z-coordinate global ocean models, at least 50 well-positioned vertical levels are required to resolve the first baroclinic mode, with an additional 25 levels per subsequent mode. High-resolution ocean-sea ice simulations are used to illustrate some of the dynamical enhancements gained by improving the vertical resolution of a 1/10° global ocean model. These enhancements include substantial increases in the sea surface height variance (∼30% increase south of 40°S), the barotropic and baroclinic eddy kinetic energies (up to 200% increase on and surrounding the Antarctic continental shelf and slopes), and the overturning streamfunction in potential density space (near-tripling of the Antarctic Bottom Water cell at 65°S).},

   abstract = {Freshwater release from melting polar ice could weaken the Atlantic overturning circulation. Eddy-resolving ocean simulations reveal that the freshening has not yet significantly affected meridional overturning, but an effect may emerge soon. The Greenland ice sheet has experienced increasing mass loss since the 1990s1,2. The enhanced freshwater flux due to both surface melt and outlet glacier discharge is assuming an increasingly important role in the changing freshwater budget of the subarctic Atlantic3. The sustained and increasing freshwater fluxes from Greenland to the surface ocean could lead to a suppression of deep winter convection in the Labrador Sea, with potential ramifications for the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation4,5,6. Here we assess the impact of the increases in the freshwater fluxes, reconstructed with full spatial resolution3, using a global ocean circulation model with a grid spacing fine enough to capture the small-scale, eddying transport processes in the subpolar North Atlantic. Our simulations suggest that the invasion of meltwater from the West Greenland shelf has initiated a gradual freshening trend at the surface of the Labrador Sea. Although the freshening is still smaller than the variability associated with the episodic ‘great salinity anomalies’, the accumulation of meltwater may become large enough to progressively dampen the deep winter convection in the coming years. We conclude that the freshwater anomaly has not yet had a significant impact on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.},

This global simulation covers the period from 1948 to 2009 and uses a fine model mesh (1/20°) to resolve mesoscale features and the complex current structure north of Iceland explicitly. The three sources of the Denmark Strait Overflow, the shelfbreak East Greenland Current (EGC), the separated EGC, and the North Icelandic Jet, have been analyzed using Eulerian and Lagrangian diagnostics. The shelfbreak EGC contributes the largest fraction in terms of volume and freshwater transport to the Denmark Strait Overflow and is the main driver of the overflow variability. The North Icelandic Jet contributes the densest water to the Denmark Strait Overflow and shows only small temporal transport variations. During summer, the net volume and freshwater transports to the south are reduced. On interannual time scales, these transports are highly correlated with the large-scale wind stress curl around Iceland and, to some extent, influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation, with enhanced southward transports during positive phases. The Lagrangian trajectories support the existence of a hypothesized overturning loop along the shelfbreak north of Iceland, where water carried by the North Icelandic Irminger Current is transformed and feeds the North Icelandic Jet. Monitoring these two currents and the region north of the Iceland shelfbreak could provide the potential to track long-term changes in the Denmark Strait Overflow and thus also the AMOC.},

   abstract = {Series of sensitivity tests were performed with a z-coordinate, global eddy-permitting (1/4°) ocean/sea-ice model (the ORCA-R025 model configuration developed for the DRAKKAR project) to carefully evaluate the impact of recent state-of-the-art numerical schemes on model solutions. The combination of an energy–enstrophy conserving (EEN) scheme for momentum advection with a partial step (PS) representation of the bottom topography yields significant improvements in the mean circulation. Well known biases in the representation of western boundary currents, such as in the Atlantic the detachment of the Gulf Stream, the path of the North Atlantic Current, the location of the Confluence, and the strength of the Zapiola Eddy in the south Atlantic, are partly corrected. Similar improvements are found in the Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans, and characteristics of the mean flow are generally much closer to observations. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art models show that the ORCA-R025 configuration generally performs better at similar resolution. In addition, the model solution is often comparable to solutions obtained at 1/6 or 1/10° resolution in some aspects concerning mean flow patterns and distribution of eddy kinetic energy. Although the reasons for these improvements are not analyzed in detail in this paper, evidence is shown that the combination of EEN with PS reduces numerical noise near the bottom, which is likely to affect current–topography interactions in a systematic way. We conclude that significant corrections of the mean biases presently seen in general circulation model solutions at eddy-permitting resolution can still be expected from the development of numerical methods, which represent an alternative to increasing resolution.},

Our study finds an 86–93% loss of STMW thickness at these sites between 2010 and 2018 and a comparable loss throughout the western subtropical gyre, culminating in the weakest STMW pentad on record. We correlate this decline with a reduction in the annual outcropping volume and northward excursions of the formation region, suggesting a gyre-wide signal of weakening STMW generation. The outcropping volume of STMW is anti-correlated with surface ocean heat content, foreshadowing future STMW loss in the face of continued warming.},

   abstract = {The Romanche Fracture Zone is a major gap in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at the equator, which is deep enough to allow significant eastward flows of Antarctic Bottom Water from the Brazil Basin to the Sierra Leone and Guinea Abyssal Plains. While flowing through the Romanche Fracture Zone, bottom-water properties are strongly modified due to intense vertical mixing. The diapycnal mixing coefficient in the bottom water of the Romanche Fracture Zone is estimated by using the finestructure of CTD profiles, the microstructure of high-resolution profiler data, and by constructing a heat budget from current meter data. The finestructure of density profiles is described using the Thorpe scales LT. It is shown from microstructure data taken in the bottom water that the Ozmidov scale LT is related to LT by the linear relationship Lo, = 0.95LT, similar to other studies, which allows an estimate of the diapycnal mixing coefficient using the Osborn relation. The Thorpe scale and the diapycnal mixing coefficient estimates show enhanced mixing downstream (eastward) of the main sill of the Romanche Fracture Zone. In this region, a mean diapycnal mixing coefficient of about 1000 × 10-4 m2 s-1 is found for the bottom water. Estimates of cross-isothermal mixing coefficient derived from the heat budgets constructed downstream of the current meter arrays deployed in the Romanche Fracture Zone and the nearby Chain Fracture Zone are in agreement with the finestructure estimates of the diapycnal mixing coefficient within the Romanche Fracture Zone. Although the two fracture zones occupy only 0.4% of the area covered by the Sierra Leone and Guinea Abyssal Plains, the diffusive heat fluxes across the 1.4°C isotherm in the Romanche and Chain Fracture Zones are half that found over the abyssal plains across the 1.8°C isotherm, emphasizing the role of these passages for bottom-water property modifications.},

Expressed as a vertical salinity maximum at the subsurface, the STUW spreads over the western subtropical and tropical South Atlantic. The mean salinity, conservative temperature, and potential density of the STUW are 36.66 ± 0.43 g/kg, 22.62 ± 2.27°C, and 25.14 ± 0.49 kg/m3, respectively. Based on the criteria derived from the STUW properties described above and the results from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) model, the production and fate of the STUW are calculated. The annual mean subduction rate is 3.26 Sv, and effective subduction occurs from September to November. Approximately 73% (2.38 Sv) of the subducted STUW is transported toward the tropical Atlantic, and 23% (0.75 Sv) of the subducted STUW is dissipated near the STUW formation region; 99% of the subducted STUW particles are dissipated within 2 years. Water particles can enter/exit the STUW along the advection route of the STUW. A total of 3.92 Sv of the STUW volume dissipates within the tropical region between 1.5°S and 1°N, implying that STUW contributes to 98% of the total transport of the subtropical cell. This analysis tracks the South Atlantic STUW from formation to dissipation and highlights the importance of the STUW in governing the subtropical cell.},

A lateral eddy viscosity of 300 m2 s-1is found to be sufficient to account for the width implied by observations. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Tropical Atlantic climate variability, in particular the strength and location of rainfall in the countries surrounding the tropical Atlantic, is very sensitive to changes in sea surface temperatures. New observations from the equatorial Atlantic link variations in sea surface temperature, wind and rainfall to variations in the velocity of deep equatorial jets. Cycles in the behaviour of the jets are propagated from the deep ocean to surface waters with a characteristic variability of about 4.5 years. The cyclic variability is not present at all times, but nonetheless reveals an important influence of intrinsic ocean variability on surface ocean climate, and points towards possible improvements in forecasting the state of the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Climate variability in the tropical Atlantic Ocean is determined by large-scale ocean–atmosphere interactions, which particularly affect deep atmospheric convection over the ocean and surrounding continents1. Apart from influences from the Pacific El Niño/Southern Oscillation2 and the North Atlantic Oscillation3, the tropical Atlantic variability is thought to be dominated by two distinct ocean–atmosphere coupled modes of variability that are characterized by meridional4,5 and zonal6,7 sea-surface-temperature gradients and are mainly active on decadal and interannual timescales, respectively8,9. Here we report evidence that the intrinsic ocean dynamics of the deep equatorial Atlantic can also affect sea surface temperature, wind and rainfall in the tropical Atlantic region and constitutes a 4.5-yr climate cycle. Specifically, vertically alternating deep zonal jets of short vertical wavelength with a period of about 4.5 yr and amplitudes of more than 10 cm s−1 are observed, in the deep Atlantic, to propagate their energy upwards, towards the surface10,11. They are linked, at the sea surface, to equatorial zonal current anomalies and eastern Atlantic temperature anomalies that have amplitudes of about 6 cm s−1 and 0.4 °C, respectively, and are associated with distinct wind and rainfall patterns. Although deep jets are also observed in the Pacific12 and Indian13 oceans, only the Atlantic deep jets seem to oscillate on interannual timescales. Our knowledge of the persistence and regularity of these jets is limited by the availability of high-quality data. Despite this caveat, the oscillatory behaviour can still be used to improve predictions of sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic. Deep-jet generation and upward energy transmission through the Equatorial Undercurrent warrant further theoretical study.},

   abstract = {Indications of an eastward current at the equator beneath the westward South Equatorial Current came originally from the drift of long-line fishing gear in use from vessels of the Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Direct observation of drifting objects, or "drags," from the Service's research vessel Hugh M. Smith during Aug. 1952 proved the existence of this eastward current in the central Pacific near the equator in the lower part of the surface layer and upper thermocline. resistance with ease of handling and stowage. A pole carrying a radar target and one carrying a flag and light were attached to the downwind end of the nets. The deep drags (Fig. 2) were similar to a common form of sea anchor. Each consisted of a light muslin cone attached to an aluminum alloy hoop weighted at the bottom and buoyed at the top so that it would remain upright. Piano wire of diameter 0.72 mm joined the deep drag unit to two streamlined floats, one at the sea surface and the other slightly submerged. The drags used were 3 and 4 m in hoop diameter, so large that retrieval was impossible and a drag could be used only once. Wind resistance of the poles prevented perfectly free movement of the surface drag with the current, and water resistance of the wire and floats similarly affected the deep drags. Corrections to reduce the drag velocities to current velocities are being determined, and a complete account of the data and results is being prepared for later publication. However, the submierged countercurrent can be described now in terms that will not be altered by these corrections. Fig. 1. Drag used to measure the surface current. The surface current at three stations was observed by following a surface drag continuously for several days and determining its movement by celestial navigation. On 12 of the 18 days devoted to following the surface drag, deep drags with identifying surface floats were released. The velocity of the deep drag was measured relative to the motion of the surface drag by following the identifying float with the vessel and tracking the surface drag by radar up to ranges of 5 mi. Vector subtraction then gives the deep drag's true velocity, which can be used to make a close estimnate of the velocity of the deep current. The surface drag (Fig. 1) consisted of two 150 by 12-ft panels of fine-mesh netting joined end to end and buoyed to locate the top of the mesh 2 ft below the sea surface. The use of nettiing combined large 1 Research spontsored by Office of Naval Research. The 12 observations of the deep current were made near 150°W from 2°54'S to 7°05'N. The first, at 2°54'S at a depth of 200 ft, gave a northwesterly current of a little less than half a knot. The following eight observations were in almost daily succession during the second drag station. The first four of these from 0°14'N to 1°31'N at depths in the lower part of the surface layer and upper thermocline indicated currents with easterly components. At the first of them, at 0°14'N, the surface current was nearly 1 knot north, while the deep drag indicated an east current stronger than 1 knot. The last four observations oii this station, from 1°50'N to 2043'N, revealed zonal flow directed west. The final three drags were used at the third drag station, near 7°N in the Equatorial Counitercurrent, where the current was easterly by both surface and deep drags.},

Although the coldest waters that appear at the bottom in each of the oceans have long been known to have come from the Southern Ocean, the characteristics indicate that the major component of the abyssal waters of the World Ocean does not derive directly from the abyssal Antarctic but from the shallower Circumpolar Water (CPW). The CPW is a mixture of Antarctic waters with the warm, saline, oxygen-rich, and nutrient-poor deep waters from the North Atlantic. As the CPW extends northward it is modified by mixing with the overlying waters, which in the North Atlantic and North Indian oceans are more saline and in the North Pacific less saline. Except for the Antarctic area, the northern North Atlantic Ocean is the major source of oxygen to the deep-ocean waters. The abyssal waters of the Northeast Pacific are farthest from regions of ventilation and are the most nearly uniform and may be the oldest of the abyssal waters. © 1983.},

   abstract = {The seasonal variations in the advection and mixing of water masses in the northern Benguela were studied in relation to the oxygen minimum zone over the Namibian shelf. The used data set consists of hydrographic and current measurements from an oceanographic mooring 20 nm off Walvis Bay, monthly CTD transects from the Namibian 23°S monitoring line and recent large-scale hydrographic surveys. The current time series showed an intermittent southward continuation of the Angola Current (AC) through the Angola-Benguela frontal zone (ABFZ) into the northern Benguela, commonly known as poleward undercurrent. In austral summer hypoxic, nutrient rich South Atlantic central water (SACW) from the Angola Gyre is transported into the northern Benguela, whereas during the winter season the oxygen rich Eastern SACW (ESACW) spreads northward. The water mass analysis reveals a mixing between both water masses in the northern Benguela between the ABFZ and the Lüderitz upwelling cell (27°S). The oxygen balance over the Namibian shelf depends to a high extent on the water mass composition of the upper central water layer, controlled by the large scale and local circulation. The deviation of the measured oxygen concentration from its mixing concentration, calculated with the source water mass properties, was used to quantify the oxygen consumption. A new local definition SACW was derived to exclude biogeochemical processes, taking place in the Angola Gyre. The oxygen deficit in the northern Benguela central water amounted to about 60-80 μmol l-1 at the shelf edge and increased up to 150 μmol l-1 on the shelf, due to local oxygen consumption. In the austral summer anoxic bottom waters are observed at the central Namibian shelf, which correlate to an SACW fraction >55%. Periods with high SACW fraction in the water mass composition were congruent with hydrogen sulphide events detected by remote sensing. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The studied area (which is influenced by the plume of the Congo River, doming, and relatively high primary production) is characterized by relatively low-circulation regime, which results in a strong oxygen minimum. In subsurface, very low cadmium: phosphate (Cd:P) ratios (0.05-0.10 nmol L_1 : mmol L_1) were observed below the euphotic zone (depth range = 50-200 m), indicating that mineralization is the main process explaining the Cd-P fractionation.Cd-P decoupling is not restricted to subsurface waters, but occurs also throughout the oxygen minimum zone. An isopycnal analysis of the Cd:P ratio throughout the Atlantic Ocean shows that upper and intermediate waters in the South-east Atlantic are highly altered in terms of Cd-P properties.

A13 and A14 provide quasi-meridional samplings of the equatorial, subequatorial and subtropical circulation regimes. A13 was carried out along the African coast at about 600 km offshore from it, and A14 along the nominal longitude 9°W. A11 intersects the Cape Basin between 46°S in the west and 30°S in the east. Transport estimates were derived from direct velocity measurements and a box inverse model. In the equatorial eastern Atlantic, the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) transport decreases from 25 x 106 m3 s-1 at 9°W to 13 x 106 m3 s-1 at 5°E. Re-circulations of the EUC into the northern and equatorial branches of the South Equatorial Current (SEC) are evidenced at 5°E and quantified. In the tropical Atlantic, we estimate 7.5 x 10 6 and 4.2 x 106 m3 s-1 for the transports at 9°W of the South Equatorial Undercurrent (SEUC) and South Equatorial Countercurrent (SECC), respectively. Both the SEUC and SECC extend vertically down to intermediate depths and contribute to the northern limb of the Angola Gyre. The Angola Current transport is estimated to be 16±5 x 106 m3 s-1 for σ1 <32.1 at 13°S. South of the Angola Gyre, the transports show an apparent cyclonic circulation, developed mostly at the intermediate level. The water mass properties suggest that it is, at least partially, a re-circulation of the Benguela Current. Further south and for the subtropical gyre, we estimate 10± 5 x 106 m3 s-1 for the transport of the South Atlantic Current across 9°W and 28±4 x 106 m3 s-1 for the transport of the Benguela Current at 10°E for σ1 <32.1. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {We examine recent observations of water mass distribution and circulation schemes at different depths of the South Atlantic Ocean to propose a layered, qualitative representation of the mean distribution of flow in this region. This furthers the simple upper layer geostrophic flow estimates of Peterson and Stramma [1991]. In addition, we assess how well ocean general circulation models (GCMs) capture the overall structure of flow in the South Atlantic in this regard. The South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) is of South Atlantic origin in the subtropical gyre, while the SACW in the tropical region in part originates from the South Indian Ocean. The Antarctic Intermediate Water in the South Atlantic originates from a surface region of the circumpolar layer, especially in the northern Drake Passage and the Falkland Current loop, but also receives some water from the Indian Ocean. The subtropical South Atlantic above the North Atlantic Deep Water and north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is dominated by the anticyclonic subtropical gyre. In the eastern tropical South Atlantic the cyclonic Angola Gyre exists, embedded in a large tropical cyclonic gyre. The equatorial part of the South Atlantic shows several depth-dependent zonal current bands besides the Angola Gyre. Ocean GCMs have difficulty capturing this detailed zonal circulation structure, even at eddy-permitting resolution. The northward extent of the subtropical gyre reduces with increasing depth, located near Brazil at 16° S in the near-surface layer and at 26° S in the Antarctic Intermediate Water layer, while the tropical cyclonic gyre progresses southward. The southward shift of the northern part of the subtropical gyre is well resolved in global ocean GCMs. However, high horizontal resolution is required to capture the South Atlantic Current north of the ACC. The North Atlantic Deep Water in the South Atlantic progresses mainly southward in the Deep Western Boundary Current, but some water also moves southward at the eastern boundary.

   abstract = {The upper ocean temperatures in the Angolan-Namibian coastal waters were anomalously high during March 1995, with positive temperature anomalies of up to 8°C. Maximum temperature differences were 30-50 m deep, reflecting a deepening of the thermocline from normal depths of 10-30 m. The unusually warm water mass covered the Angolan coast from Cabinda (5°S), the northern limit of the survey area, to at least 24°S off central Namibia. Higher than normal temperatures were observed as far south as Luderitz (27°S). Satellite-derived SST and direct observations indicated that the seaward distribution of warm water extended more than 300 km from the coast. Surface drogues released inshore along the central Namibian shelf suggested a maximum southward extension by 3 March 1995. The warm event was associated with observed mortalities in sardine Sardinops sagax, horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis and kob Argyrosomus inodorus off the coast. It also caused a southward displacement of sardine stocks from Angola, resulting in an increased availability of pelagic fish in Namibian waters. Conditions have occasionally been anomalously warm in Angolan and Namibian waters in the past, with the last major event in 1984. These events are known as Benguela Ninos, because of their resemblance to the well known Pacific El Nino. The 1995 Benguela Nino appeared to be associated with a positive subsurface salinity anomaly of 0.5 x 10-3 in Namibian waters and a negative (-4.0 x 10-3) surface salinity anomaly in Angolan waters, thought to be derived from the freshwater input of the Congo River.},

   abstract = {The 1992-1993 Benguela Sources and Transport (BEST) time series provide a quantitative view of the Benguela Current transport and the eddy field crossing 30S, as well as an estimate of the relation between its barotropic and baroclinic components. This is done by a simultaneous analysis of the BEST data derived from inverted echo sounders, pressure sensors, current meter moorings, CTD, and ADCP stations. The analysis of the time series indicates that the annual mean baroclinic transport of the Benguela Current is 13 Sv with a total transport of 16 Sv. Through the combination of instruments the total baroclinic plus barotropic transport of the upper 2600 m was obtained without making any assumption about the level of no motion. Results from this calculation corroborated the assumption that 1000 m as a level of no motion could be used as a fairly good approximation. The stationary flow of the Benguela Current is mostly confined near the African Continent while a transient flow, composed by large eddies shed from the Agulhas retroflection, dominates the western portion of the Benguela Current. In the stationary part of the Benguela Current, both barotropic and baroclinic components are equally important while in the transient part, the barotropic is more substantial. Several rings were observed during the experiment that migrated toward the west. An initial speed of 12 km/day diminished to 6 to 7 km/day at the Walvis Ridge. The water mass source of the Benguela Current includes Indian and South Atlantic subtropical thermocline water; relatively saline, low oxygen tropical Atlantic water; and the cooler, fresher subantarctic water. Changes in thermocline salinity correlate with transport: in general when the northward transport is increasing the thermocline salinity also increases, without a decrease in oxygen. This indicates that the Benguela Current increases in strength by bringing in more subtropical thermocline water. As the Agulhas input is most effective in boosting the salinity of the upper thermocline (the South Atlantic Current water being deficit in salinity relative to the Indian Ocean source) we suggest that the spatial variations in transport are tied to Agulhas water influx, presumably associated with the eddy field.},

   abstract = {Formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) represents a transfer of upper layer water to abyssal depths at a rate of 15 to 20 x 10 6 m3/s. NADW spreads throughout the Atlantic Ocean and is exported to the Indian and Pacific Oceans by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and deep western boundary currents. Naturally, there must be a compensating flow of upper layer water toward the northern North Atlantic to feed NADW production. It is proposed that this return flow is accomplished primarily within the ocean's warm water thermocline layer. In this way the main thermoclines of the ocean are linked as they participate in a thermohaline-driven global scale circulation cell associated with NADW formation. The path of the return flow of warm water is as follows: Pacific to Indian flow within the Indonesian Seas, advection across the Indian Ocean in the 10ø-15øS latitude belt, southward transfer in the Mozambique Channel, entry into the South Atlantic by a branch of the Agulhas Current that does not complete the retroflection pattern, northward advection within the subtropical gyre of the South Atlantic (which on balance with the southward flux of colder North Atlantic Deep Water supports the northward oceanic heat flux characteristic of the South Atlantic), and cross-equatorial flow into the western North Atlantic. The magnitude of the return flow increases along its path as more NADW is incorporated into the upper layer of the ocean. Additionally, the water mass characteristics of the return flow are gradually altered by regional ocean-atmosphere interaction and mixing processes. Within the Indonesian seas there is evidence of strong vertical mixing across the thermocline. The cold water route, Pacific to Atlantic transport of Subantarctic water within the Drake Passage, is of secondary importance, amounting to perhaps 25% of the warm water route transport. The continuity or vigor of the warm water route is vulnerable to change not only as the thermohaline forcing in the northern North Atlantic varies but also as the larger-scale wind-driven criculation factors vary. The interocean links within the Indonesian seas and at the Agulhas retroflection may be particularly responsive to such variability. Changes in the warn: water route continuity may in turn influence formation characteristics of NADW.},

   abstract = {Data from a hydrographic section carried out in January-March 1994 offshore from the eastern coast of South America from 50S to 10N, are used to quantify the full-depth exchanges of water between the western boundary currents and the ocean interior. In the upper and intermediate layers, the westward transport associated with the southern branch of the South Equatorial Current was 49 Sv at the time of the cruise. The transports of the central and northern branches in the upper 200 m were 17 Sv and 12 Sv, respectively. After subtraction of the parts that recirculate in the subtropical, subequatorial, and equatorial domains, the fraction of the South Equatorial Current that effectively contributes to the warm water export to the North Atlantic is estimated at 18 Sv. The poleward boundary of the current southern branch is at 31S through the whole thickness of the subtropical gyre, but the latitude of the northern boundary varies from 7°30'S at the surface to 27S at 1400 m depth. The estimated latitude of its bifurcation into the Brazil Current and North Brazil Undercurrent also varies downward from about 14S at the surface to 28S at a depth of 600 m. In the North Atlantic Deep Water, eastward flows exceeding 10 Sv are observed at 3°-4° of latitude in both hemispheres, at 10S, and at 34S-30S. Between 4S and 17S, a net westward flow with an estimated transport of 19 Sv reinforces the southward deep western boundary current. Cyclonic circulations of Antarctic Bottom Water along the western boundaries of the Argentine and Brazil basins have amplitudes of 15 Sv and 13 Sv, respectively, exceeding those of the interbasin exchanges. The net alongshore transport of this water mass between the hydrographic section and the continental slope reverses to a southward direction from 13S to 27S, probably in relation with an eastward shift of the equatorward near-bottom boundary current at these latitudes.},

   abstract = {The main flow patterns and transports of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) in the eastern South Atlantic and round southern Africa were inferred from two quasi-meridional WOCE hydrographic lines at 9°W and 5°E nominal longitudes, and from segments of other sections in the Atlantic-to-Indian Oceans transition region. An export of 11 ± 4 Sv of NADW from the Atlantic was estimated near southern Africa inshore of the Subtropical Front. Most of this flow can be traced back across the Cape Basin to passages south of 28°S in Walvis Ridge, and farther upstream to an entry in the eastern basin at 20-25°S. Other transfers of NADW from the western boundary current to the eastern boundary were confirmed near the equator and at 22°S near the Namib Col of Walvis Ridge, yet a cyclonic recirculation of the former in the Angola Basin, and the weakness of the latter (4 ± 2 Sv), make their direct contributions to the export of NADW minor ones. As another consequence, the estimated transport of the deep southward boundary current against the western continental slope of Africa shows important latitudinal variations (12 ± 9Sv at 7°30'S, 3 ± 5 Sv at 22°30′S, 11 ± 4 Sv at 35°S), with even a suggestion of its reversal in the northern Cape Basin. To the southwest of Cape Town, the deep boundary current is influenced by the temporal variability of the Agulhas retroflection region, and most of it separates from the slope to enter the Indian Ocean in the deep return flow of the Agulhas Current. Only a 2-3 Sv remnant against the continental slope was estimated at 30°E to the east of the Agulhas Plateau. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Transatlantic hydrographic sections along 7°30N and 4°30S, and shorter meridional ones along 35°W and 4°W in the intervening latitudinal range, provide a basin-wide description of the Atlantic water masses at their crossing of the equator. The water masses belonging to either the cold or warm segment of the global thermohaline cell enter the equatorial region mostly in the form of western boundary currents. The ways they leave it are more varied. The Ekman drift and a geostrophic western boundary current cause the export of near-surface water to the North Atlantic. A part of the southern Salinity Maximum Water, regarded as the shallowest warm water component, is thought to follow this route after experiencing strong property modification in the equatorial upwelling. The underlying South Atlantic Central Water divides into two northward paths, a direct one along the south American continental slope, hardly observed in the data because of an intense variability in the western half of the 7°30N line, and a longer one through the eastern basin, taken by water of the equatorial thermostad. There is no trace of such an eastern northward route for the Antarctic Intermediate Water, which is apparently forced northward from the equatorial region through the highly variable circulation of the western basin. The deep western boundary currents carrying southward the upper and middle components of the North Atlantic Deep Water experience a first partial shift to the eastern boundary on crossing the equator. At deeper levels, a part of the lower North Atlantic Deep Water also bifurcates eastward at the equator, but loses its identity through vertical mixing with the Antarctic Bottom Water in the equatorial fracture zones. The newly formed homogeneous bottom water proceeds eastward in the Guinea Basin, with further indication of an overflow into the Angola Basin. Beside the North Atlantic Deep Water, the deep layer of the equatorial region contains a lower-oxygen component, most clearly present between the middle and lower cores of the North Atlantic Deep Water. Previous results on this water are substantiated, namely, an arrival from the southeast, and northwestward crossing of the equator offshore from the deep western boundary current of northern water. A further northward progression of the southern water requires that the equatorial branching of the southward deep boundary current be only intermittent. A comparison of the temperatures along 7°30N in 1993 with those obtained at 8°N during the International Geophysical Year, 36 years before, reveals a net warming of the intermediate and upper deep waters, and cooling of the bottom water. This result is similar to that obtained at 24°N by other authors, yet there are signs of a southward propagation of a deep cold anomaly in the western basin, which had reached 24°N in 1992, but not yet 7°30N in 1993.},

   abstract = {A conductivity-temperature-depth and tracer chemistry section in the southeast South Atlantic in December 1989 and January 1990 presents strong evidence that there is a significant interocean exchange of thermocline and intermediate water between the South Atlantic and Indian oceans. Eastward flowing water at 10øW composed of South Atlantic Central (thermocline) Water is too enriched with chlorofluoromethanes 11 and 12 and oxygen to be the sole source of similar O-S water within the northward flowing Benguela Current. About two thirds of the Benguela Current thermocline transport is drawn from the Indian Ocean; the rest is South Atlantic water that has folded into the Benguela Current in association with the Agulhas eddy-shedding process. South Atlantic Central water passes in the Indian Ocean by a route to the south of the Agulhas Return Current. The South Atlantic water loops back to the Atlantic within the Indian Ocean, perhaps mostly within the Agulhas recirculation cell of the southwest Indian Ocean. Linkage of Atlantic and Indian Ocean water diminishes with increasing depth; it extends through the lower thermocline into the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) (about 50% is derived from the Indian Ocean) but not into the deep water. While much of the interocean exchange remains on an approximate horizontal "isopycnal" plane, as much as 10 x i0 6 m 3 s -! ofindian Ocean water within the 25 x 10 6 m 3 s -I Bengueia derived from the lower thermocline and AAIW, may balance deeper Atlantic export of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The addition of salt water from the evaporative Indian Ocean into the South Atlantic Ocean thermocline and AAIW levels may precondition the Atlantic for NADW formation. While AAIW seems to be the chief feed for NADW, the bulk of it enters the subtropical South Atlantic, spiked with Indian Ocean salt, within the Benguela Current rather than along the western boundary of the South Atlantic.},

   abstract = {Combining in-situ Lagrangian intermediate depth velocity measurements from the KAPEX (Cape of Good Hope Experiments) float program with sea-surface height data, this study reviews the inter-ocean exchange mechanisms around southern Africa. In the southeastern Cape Basin, a highly energetic field of coexisting anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies is documented. Agulhas Rings of typically 200 km diameter are observed to merge, split, deform, and to reconnect to the Agulhas Retroflection. Concomitant, slightly smaller cyclones are observed to drift across the northwestward migration path of the Agulhas Rings. These cyclones, with typical diameters of 120 km, are formed within the Cape Basin along the African shelf, inshore of the Agulhas Current, and in the subantarctic region south of Africa. The data suggest the annual formation of 3-6 long-lived Agulhas Rings that eventually cross 5°E longitude, while approximately twice the number of rings occur in the southeastern Cape Basin. Within this region, cyclones outnumber anticyclones by a factor of 3:2. Both cyclones and anticyclones extend through the upper thermocline into the intermediate depth layer. Mean drifts of anticyclones are 3.8±1.2 cm s-1 to the northwest, while cyclones follow a west-southwestward route at 3.6±0.8 cm s-1. Transport estimates suggest that the intermediate depth layer in the southeastern Cape Basin is primarily supplied from the east (approximately 9 Sv), with minor direct inflow from the Atlantic to the west and south. Cyclone/anticyclone interaction is surmised to result in vigorous stirring and mixing processes in the southeastern Cape Basin, which necessitates a review of the traditional concept of Indo-Atlantic inter-ocean exchange. We propose to limit the concept of "isolated Agulhas Rings embedded in a sluggish Benguela Drift" to the northwestern Cape Basin and beyond, while linking this regime to the Agulhas Retroflection proper through a zone of turbulent stirring and mixing in the southeastern Cape Basin, named for the first time the "Cape Cauldron" hereinafter. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Discovery cruise 165B in May 1987, reveals the water mass structure and associated velocity field of the shelf and upper slope of the Benguela upwelling system. Continental shelf water upwelling within the Benguela Current is drawn from the 12°C (about 200 m) level. The upwelling water is drawn from oxygen depleted, tropical South Atlantic thermocline water that is advected along the shelf floor by a southward flowing subsurface current. Lower thermocline and intermediate water from the tropical South Atlantic are also observed flowing southward over the continental slope. Tropical Atlantic water generally resides north of the Angola-Benguela Front at 16°S. A narrow band of upwelled water is observed well seaward of the shelf, along the western edge of a large Agulhas eddy, indicating that Agulhas eddies play a role in stirring eastern boundary upwelled water into the ocean interior. These eddies also draw into the interior tropical Atlantic water found over the upper continental slope. The net transport between the 120 and 350 isobaths as measured by the ship-mounted ADCP, referenced to the sea floor, is 0.9 × 106 m3 s-1 1 to the south, with 1.6 × 106 m3 s-1 of southward flowing tropical Atlantic water and 0.7 × 106 m3 s-1 of northward flowing upwelled surface water. The tropical thermocline water mass advected to the south is not observed offshore within the northward flowing Benguela Current, in an unaltered state, thus the 0.9 × 106 m3 s-1 must feed shelf upwelling south of 27°S, implying a net offshore flux of upwelled water between Ld̈eritz (26°) and Cape Columbine (33°S). © 1995.},

   abstract = {Recent evaluations of the global nitrogen budget include greatly increased estimates of N2-fixation in oceanic waters. Low stable N isotope ratios in planktonic food webs of tropical and subtropical oceans have been used as one indication of the importance of N2-fixation. Interpretation of bulk stable N isotope ratios can, however, be confounded when the source and process information that they contain cannot be separated clearly. In this paper, we use stable N isotope ratios of amino acids to help separate source and trophic effects associated with changes in bulk stable N isotope ratios of zooplankton across the tropical North Atlantic. Patterns in stable N isotope ratios of amino acids along a transect from the Cape Verde Islands to Barbados identify a change in N source supporting zooplankton production, and virtually no change in the trophic position of zooplankton size classes from the eastern to the western side of the tropical North Atlantic. Furthermore, comparison of stable N isotope ratios of amino acids in zooplankton with those in Trichodesmium suggests that diazotrophs are the source of the low stable N isotope ratios at the western end of the transect. The evidence provided by stable N isotope ratios of amino acids supports the interpretation of large-scale patterns in bulk stable N isotope ratios that N2-fixation indeed makes a major contribution to the global N budget. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

At 4.5°S, the Warm Water (potential temperature θ 4.5°C) originating from the South Atlantic enters the equatorial Atlantic, principally at the western boundary, in the thermocline-intensified North Brazil Undercurrent (33 ±2.7 × 106 m3 s-1 northward) and in the surface-intensified South Equatorial Current (8 × 106 m3 s-1 northward) located to the east of the North Brazil Undercurrent. The Ekman transport at 4.5°S is southward (10.7 ± 1.5 × 106 m3 s-1). At 7.5°N, the Western Boundary Current (WBC) (17.9 ± 2 × 106 m3 s-1) is weaker than at 4.5°S, and the northward flow of Warm Water in the WBC is complemented by the basin-wide Ekman flow (12.3 ±1.0± 106 m3 s-1), the net contribution of the geostrophic interior flow of Warm Water being southward. The equatorial Ekman divergence drives a conversion of Thermocline Water (24.58 ≤σο < 26.75) into Surface Water (σο < 24.58) of 7.5±0.5 × 106 m3 s-1, mostly occurring west of 35°W. The Deep Water of northern origin flows southward at 7.5°N in an energetic (48 ± 3 × 106 m3 s-1) Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC), whose transport is in part compensated by a northward recirculation (21±4.5 × 106 m3 s-1) in the Guiana Basin. At 4.5°S, the DWBC is much less energetic (27 ± 7 × 106 m3 s-1 southward) than at 7.5°N. It is in part balanced by a deep northward recirculation east of which alternate circulation patterns suggest the existence of an anticyclonic gyre in the central Brazil Basin and a cyclonic gyre further east. The deep equatorial Atlantic is characterized by a convergence of Lower Deep Water (45.90 ≤σ4 < 45.83), which creates an upward diapycnal transport of 11.0 × 106 m3 s-1 across σ4 = 45.83. The amplitude of this diapycnal transport is quite sensitive to the a priori hypotheses made in the inverse model. The amplitude of the meridional overturning cell is estimated to be 22× 106m3s-1 at 7.5°N and 24×106m3s-1 at 4.5°S.

   abstract = {Seven floats (not launched in rings) crossed over the mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Benguela extension with a mean westward velocity of around 2 cm/s between 22S and 35S. Two Agulhas rings crossed over the mid-Atlantic Ridge with a mean velocity of 5.7 cm/s toward 285°. This implies they translated at around 3.8 cm/s through the background velocity field near 750 m. The boundaries of the Benguela Current extension were clearly defined from the observations. At 750 m the Benguela extension was bounded on the south by 35S and the north by an eastward current located between 18S and 21S. Other recent float measurements suggest that this eastward current originates near the Trindade Ridge close to the western boundary and extends across most of the South Atlantic, limiting the Benguela extension from flowing north of around 20S. The westward transport of the Benguela extension was estimated to be 15 Sv by integrating the mean westward velocities from 22S to 35S and multiplying by the 500 m estimated thickness of intermediate water. Roughly 1.5 Sv of this are transported by the ∼3 Agulhas rings that cross the mid-Atlantic Ridge each year (as observed with altimetry). This value of the Benguela extension transport is the first one to have been obtained from long-term (two-year) observations and across the full width of the Benguela extension. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {In this paper we present data from a number of crossings of the boundary between subtropical and subpolar water in the 15°W-5°E region of the South Atlantic and discuss the implications. The previous paucity of synoptic data sets near 40°S between 25°W and the Greenwich Meridian meant that up to now it has not been possible to fix the position of the boundary in the mid-South Atlantic or to deduce the effects of the midocean ridge on the strength of the South Atlantic Current (SAC). Using hydrographic and chemical tracer data we confirm that the transition from subtropical to subpolar waters occurs within a Subtropical Frontal Zone (STFZ), which constrains the South Atlantic Current flow and is bounded on each side by a distinct front The northern one, the Northern Subtropical Front (NSTF) varies by only 1 5°of latitude, whereas the southern one, the South Subtropical Front (SSTF), the traditional Subtropical Convergence (STC, defined by Deacon, 1937), migrates over 2.5°of latitude and remains south of the island of Tristan da Cunha. This finding goes some way in resolving the disparity in the literature to the position and seasonal migration of the STC. The data confirm the existence of a subsurface salinity maximum lobe, which appears to be formed at the NSTF rather than at the SSTF. By closely investigating the mesoscale structure and comparing it with historical data from a number of meridional cruises, we have shown strong seasonality in the frontal structure between 30 and 45°S in the South Atlantic Having resolved the fine structure, we have made an estimate of the geostropic flow of the SAC and suggest that there are east to west differences, which may be related to recirculation in the Argentine Basin rather than to a slowing down by the midocean ridge.},

Transport estimates from hydrographic sections on the Walvis Ridge and at 15°W near the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge indicate a strength of about 3 × 106 m3 s-1. The current is part of a larger-scale eastward flow at Lon. 25°W; transport estimates across the salinity maximum core there show a similar strength. Associated with this high-salinity high-oxygen current is a basin-wide front in these properties of varying intensity (weaker in the east) marking the transition to deep water whose North Atlantic characteristics have been partly erased by mixing with Circumpolar Deep Water in the southwest South Atlantic. The water which finally crosses the Walvis Ridge is supplied both by the eastward flow of this (diluted) North Atlantic Deep Water and by a general southeastward interior flow from the northern Angola Basin. Evidence suggests that this deep water continues south in the eastern Cape Basin, leaving the South Atlantic near the African continent. © 1995.},

The wind-driven Ekman layer in the upper tens of meters of the ocean masks at some places the flow structure of the Tropical Surface Water layer as is the case for the Angola Gyre in the eastern tropical South Atlantic. Although there are regions with a strong seasonal cycle of the Tropical Surface Water circulation, such as the North Equatorial Countercurrent, large regions of the tropics do not show a significant seasonal cycle. In the Central Water layer below, the eastward North and South Equatorial undercurrents appear imbedded in the westward-flowing South Equatorial Current. The Antarcic Intermediate Water layer contains several zonal current bands south of 3°N, but only weak flow exists north of 3°N. The sparse available data suggest that the Equatorial Intermediate Current as well as the Southern and Northern Intermediate Countercurrents extend zonally across the entire equatorial basin. Due to the convergence of northern and southern water masses, the western tropical Atlantic north of the equator is an important site for the mixture of water masses, but more work is needed to better understand the role of the various zonal under- and countercurrents in cross-equatorial water mass transfer.},

   abstract = {A quasi-meridional hydrographic section located offshore from South America from 50°S to 10°N, and three shorter transverse lines to the continental slope, are used for a descriptive study of the water masses along the western boundary of the South and Equatorial Atlantic. At the upper and intermediate levels, the tracer analysis provides geographical limits of the wind-driven circulation regimes, and a comparison of the tracer values at the continental slope and along the meridional section shows where the boundary currents originate. At depths shallower than about 200 m, the subdivision of the subtropical gyre into two cells separated by the Subtropical Countercurrent near 28°S, that was pointed out in a previous study, is corroborated. South of this front, a warm variety (18°C) of Subtropical Mode Water in the inner recirculation of the Brazil Current appears, despite its limited extent, as a southern counterpart of the North Atlantic 18°C water. At the deep levels, the Upper Circumpolar Water and Upper North Atlantic Deep Water enter the South Atlantic in a significantly overlapping density range. The ensuing lateral encounter of both water masses occurs at 26°S near the western boundary, where most of the boundary flow of the latter water is stopped and deflected seaward by the base of the subtropical gyre. Other tracer anomalies signal significant eastward escapes of North Atlantic Deep Water: within two jets at about two degrees of latitude on either side of the equator, in another narrow current at 10°S, and at 34°S. The latter latitude marks the confluence, and eastward deflection, of the opposite boundary currents of Lower North Atlantic Deep Water and Lower Circumpolar Water. Near the bottom of the Argentine Basin, the Weddell Sea Deep Water that flows westward north of the Zapiola Ridge is more recently ventilated than the water carried by the boundary current near the Falkland Escarpment. While a part of it flows anticyclonically around the ridge, another part turns equatorward and enhances the southern property signatures of the water farther north. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

   abstract = {There are three major permanent thermostads with roughly the same potential densities in the upper layer of the Atlantic Ocean. One is the thermostad of the 13°C Water in the equatorial Atlantic. The original type of the 13°C Water is formed in the thermocline in the eastern sector of the South Atlantic subtropical gyre by vertical mixing of dense, low-salinity water from the winter outcrop farther south and overlying less dense, high-salinity water. There might also be a lateral contribution of relatively high-salinity water from the Indian Ocean. The original 13°C Water thus formed is transported northwestward along the northern edge of the subtropical gyre and fed into the North Brazilian Current, which flows equatorward along the coast of Brazil. In the region of the equator, the Equatorial Undercurrent and the subsurface North and South Equatorial countercurrents branch off from the North Brazilian Current and carry the 13°C Water eastward to the thermostad region. Vertical mixing does not explain the development of the thermostad, but is found to be essential in determining the ultimate characteristics of the 13°C Water. The other two thermostads are those of the 18°C Water in the Sargasso Sea and the Subantarctic Mode Water in the western South Atlantic. Unlike the 13°C Water, both of these mode waters are formed as thermostads in the surface layer by winter convection, but vertical mixing in the subtropical gyres may play a role in determining their characteristics. All the three thermostads appear to be required to balance the system of flows in opposing directions. © 1986.},

   abstract = {Tracer properties on sections of closely spaced hydrographic stations across the Angola Basin of the South Atlantic Ocean along Lats 11° and 24°S suggest a three-layer description of the deep circulation there. Below 4 km the basin is closed off in the south, so water enters only from the north; the interior flow is southward, and the western-boundary current (above the eastern flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge) is southward at 11°S but northward at 24°S, as required by the Stommel-Arons dynamics. At depths roughly between 2400 and 4000 m the basin seems to be supplied only from the south, the western-boundary current is everywhere northward, and the interior flow is southward. Near the 2-km level the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is too deep to be an effective western boundary; the flow seems to he broadly southeastward across the full basin at l1°S, but at 24°S a topographically guided current flows northward above the ridge to supply southward interior flow. A hydrographic section along the Greenwich meridian illustrates an eastward jet at depths between 1300 and 3200 m that extends near Lat. 22°S from the western-boundary curent to a gap in the Walvis Ridge, through which the jet introduces water to the Cape Basin. Geostrophic estimates of the volume transports of these circulation clements, calculated with reference to zero-velocity surfaces construed from the tracer fields, are consistent in direction with the inferred flow patterns, but the values may be somewhat erroneously high, as they imply dubiously large upward velocities. A tongue of oxygen-poor, nutrient-rich water is found at depths between 3000 and 4500 m at 11°S but not at 24°S. It is strongest at the African continental rise, and extends some 1000 km westward. Its origin is attributed to decay within the ~ediment of detritus originating mainly from the Congo River plume, and its form to the deep horizontal flow field.},

The method is applied to nest a high vertical and horizontal resolution Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) domain covering the north-central Gulf of Mexico within a HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) Gulf of Mexico domain. The northwestern Gulf of Mexico has a very steep topographic feature, the Sigsbee Escarpment, over which localized bottom-intensified currents with short cross-isobath length scales have been observed in water depths between 1500. m and 3000. m. It has been hypothesized that these intense currents are related to the presence of the Loop Current or Loop Current Eddies, strong upper ocean mesoscale circulation features in the Gulf. A modeling system is required that can resolve the short length scales of topography and the currents, resolve the vertical trapping of the currents, and realistically simulate the mesoscale upper and deep ocean circulation features. The multi-model nesting approach described here simulates these intense currents with characteristics very similar to observations, and demonstrates the connectivity to the larger scale ocean circulation features. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Marine particles play key roles in the cycling of most elements in the ocean. Here we present full water column sections of size-fractionated (1–51 μm; > 51 μm) concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and major particle phase composition, including particulate organic matter (POM), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), opal, lithogenic particles, and iron and manganese (oxyhydr)oxides, as well as the Redfield (C:N:P) stoichiometry of particles, from the U.S. GEOTRACES GP16 Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect (EPZT). The GP16 cruise sampled the oxygen deficient waters of the productive eastern upwelling Peru margin westward to Tahiti through the East Pacific Rise (EPR) hydrothermal plume around 12°S in October–December 2013. In this region of relatively low mineral dust deposition, the sum of POM and CaCO3 concentrations accounted for > 80% of small size fraction (SSF) SPM for most of the section. Some exceptions to this include the southern EPR hydrothermal plume, where iron oxyhydroxides accounted for almost 60% of SSF SPM, and the coastal upwelling zone, where opal and lithogenic particles accounted for ~ 50% of SSF SPM. We discuss possible mechanisms to explain a large sediment resuspension feature on the deep Peru continental slope. Large size fraction (LSF) particles generally had relatively higher contributions of opal and lower contributions of POM compared to SSF particles, reflecting an unusually high size partitioning of opal to the LSF. Distributions of CaCO3 and other phases were more strongly controlled by particle dynamics than by dissolution. Our particle phase data are consistent with a conceptual model where particle production, aggregation, and disaggregation processes dominate in the euphotic, 100–300 m, and 300–500 m depth zones, respectively. Our direct measurements of particle composition showed 1) euphotic zone C vs P relationships (SSF: 48 ± 13; LSF: 65 ± 14) that were significantly lower than canonical Redfield values (~ 106), but that were consistent with previously published large scale inverse and box model estimates of exported C:P for this region, and 2) PIC:POC ratios (LSF: 0.088) that were remarkably similar to estimated rain ratios from a biogeochemical-transport box model of alkalinity and nitrate in the low latitude Pacific.},

   abstract = {Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), where the concentrations of oxygen are at analytical detection limits, but sulfate reduction is not occurring, are termed suboxic and typically nitrate serves as the terminal electron acceptor for heterotrophic respiration. Such respiration is highest near the top of OMZs where maxima in nitrite and other redox active species are observed. Within OMZs, the availability of free electrons for reduction reactions (pε) can range from − 2 to 10 and at thermodynamic equilibrium could control the oxidation states of essential trace elements like iron and toxic ones like arsenic. In turn, this oxidation/reduction speciation affects trace element solubility and bioavailability, thus controlling their reactivity and transport. Field observations and mesoscale models demonstrate the increasing areal extent of oxygen minimum zones, but whether this in turn affects trace element cycling and fluxes remains to be verified. From current observations, it is difficult to determine the relative importance of in situ processes and lateral transport from boundaries to trace elements' redox cycling, which are typically highly redox- and biologically-active in these systems. Such processes could lead to the co-occurrence of redox species that are not controlled by a unique pε. In order to evaluate the effects of in situ redox processes versus advective/diffusive transport on trace elements, the cycling of nitrate/nitrite, iodate/iodide, Fe(II), As(III)/As(V), and hydrogen sulfide was examined in the low oxygen waters off the Peru shelf to the open South Pacific Ocean during the US GEOTRACES GP16 transect in 2013. Nitrite, Fe(II), and iodide were observed from the shelf to 95° W, while reduced forms of sulfur and arsenic were absent. Maxima in nitrite, Fe(II) and iodide were coincident, indicating the utilization of Fe(III), iodate and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors was possible. For iron, this finding was unexpected with regards to thermodynamics. However, closer inspection combined with advective/diffusive modeling of water column data and 228Ra-based flux calculations, showed that benthic redox processes, coupled with westward isopycnal transport, influenced the chemical composition and redox speciation within the upper OMZ well offshore. This horizontal transport contributed to the coexistence of Fe(II) with nitrate, indicating that Fe redox chemistry is under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control.},

   abstract = {Fluorescence sensors mounted on unmanned underwater gliders open new ways of investigation to detect dissolved hydrocarbons in seawater. A glider was deployed for 20 days to monitor biogeochemical and physical signals associated with natural hydrocarbon seepages within the first 700 m in the Angolan waters. The glider was equipped with fluorometers (MiniFluo-UV) to measure the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) of interest, i.e. naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene and pyrene. A continuous PAH-like signal detected within the 70 m layer below the sea surface is associated with high chlorophyll concentration in the deep chlorophyll maximum. Vertical PAH-like anomalies forming either strong spikes or diffuse columns down to 700 m are observed at the exact location of oil seep sites identified on Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite images. An ~200 m thick layer of enhanced PAH-like concentration, topped by a thermo/pycnocline identified at 280–300 m water depth, is measured in concomitance with the decrease in oxygen concentration. The concomitance of these signals suggests that lower oxygen concentrations induce a preservation of hydrocarbons within the eastern Atlantic oxygen minimum zone. Even if the absence of in-situ measurements limits the understanding of physical and biogeochemical processes affecting PAH concentrations, the measurements conducted at the edges of the OMZ suggests a relationship with microbial activity and organic matter dynamics in this layer. The results presented here show that gliders equipped with PAH sensors represent a promising means for monitoring hydrocarbons in the oceans, especially when they are coupled with other systems (i.e. Synthetic Aperture Radar).},

Transports of anthropogenic carbon are calculated across the western (Drake Passage), eastern (30°E) and northern (24°S) boundaries. The freshwater overturning transport of 0.09 Sv is southward, consistent with an overturning circulation that exports freshwater from the North Atlantic, and consistent with a bistable Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), under conditions of excess freshwater perturbation. At 30°E, net eastward Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transport, south of the Subtropical Front, is compensated by a 15.9 ± 2.3 Sv westward flow along the Antarctic boundary. The region as a whole is a substantial sink for atmospheric anthropogenic carbon of 0.51 ± 0.37 Pg C yr−1, of which 0.18 ± 0.12 Pg C yr−1 accumulates and is stored within the water column. At 24°S, a 20.2 Sv meridional overturning is associated with a 0.11 Pg C yr−1 Cant overturning. The remainder is transported into the Atlantic Ocean north of 24°S (0.28 ± 0.16 Pg C yr−1) and Indian sector of Southern Ocean (1.12 ± 0.43 Pg C yr−1), having been enhanced by inflow through Drake Passage (1.07 ± 0.44 Pg C yr−1).

This furthers the simple upper layer geostrophic flow estimates of Peterson and Stramma [1991]. In addition, we assess how well ocean general circulation models (GCMs) capture the overall structure of flow in the South Atlantic in this regard. The South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) is of South Atlantic origin in the subtropical gyre, while the SACW in the tropical region in part originates from the South Indian Ocean. The Antarctic Intermediate Water in the South Atlantic originates from a surface region of the circumpolar layer, especially in the northern Drake Passage and the Falkland Current loop, but also receives some water from the Indian Ocean. The subtropical South Atlantic above the North Atlantic Deep Water and north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is dominated by the anticyclonic subtropical gyre. In the eastern tropical South Atlantic the cyclonic Angola Gyre exists, embedded in a large tropical cyclonic gyre. The equatorial part of the South Atlantic shows several depth-dependent zonal current bands besides the Angola Gyre. Ocean GCMs have difficulty capturing this detailed zonal circulation structure, even at eddy-permitting resolution. The northward extent of the subtropical gyre reduces with increasing depth, located near Brazil at 16° S in the near-surface layer and at 26° S in the Antarctic Intermediate Water layer, while the tropical cyclonic gyre progresses southward. The southward shift of the northern part of the subtropical gyre is well resolved in global ocean GCMs. However, high horizontal resolution is required to capture the South Atlantic Current north of the ACC. The North Atlantic Deep Water in the South Atlantic progresses mainly southward in the Deep Western Boundary Current, but some water also moves southward at the eastern boundary.

   abstract = {The main feature of the Congo-Angola margin in the Gulf of Guinea is the Congo (ex-Zaire) deep-sea fan composed of a submarine canyon directly connected to the Congo River, a channel and a [sediment] lobe area. During the multi-disciplinary programme called BIOZAIRE conducted by Ifremer from 2000 to 2005, two CTD-O2 sections with discrete water column samples were performed (BIOZAIRE3 cruise: 2003-2004) to study the influence of the Congo River discharges, both in the surface layer and in the deep and near-bottom layers. The surface layer water is greatly diluted with river water that has a heavy particle load. The deep layer is affected by episodic turbidity currents that flow in the deep Congo channel and reach deep areas far from the coast. Previous studies revealed deep anomalies in oxygen (deficit) and nutrient (excess) concentrations at ∼4000 m depth and assumed that they resulted from mineralisation of the particulate organic matter from the Congo River. The BIOZAIRE3 sections were designed to explore these phenomena in more detail near the Congo channel. Oxygen and nutrients were measured as well as additional parameters, including stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon and pH. For the surface layer, the effect of the Congo River was studied with reference to salinity. Deviations from the theoretical dilution of various inorganic solutes suggested the occurrence of mineralisation and consumption processes. For the deep layer, the network of CTD-O2 stations gave a more detailed description of the deep anomalies than in previous studies. From the east-west section, anomalies appeared on the bottom at 4000 m depth and became slightly shallower when they spread to the west. They were also present north and south on the bottom along the 4000 m isobath. In these deep waters, the decrease in the δ13C values of dissolved inorganic carbon confirmed that the mineralisation of organic matter plays a role in generating these anomalies. The location of the origin of this deep anomaly is debated. Here, arguments are given in favour of mineralisation of the particulate organic matter input that overflows from the Congo channel at ∼4000 m depth during turbidity current events. Other authors suggest that this input comes from downslope particle transport. Anomalies of the same origin, but weaker, also occurred deeper on the Congo lobe, where the Congo channel ends, but with a significant pH decrease on the bottom which was not seen at 4000 m depth. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The Benguela system is one of the four major eastern boundary upwelling systems of the world. It is unusual as there are two stratified subtropical or warm temperate boundary regions, on either side of the major wind-driven upwelling region(19-34°S), which itself is subdivided at 26°S by the powerful Luderitz upwelling cell. Important biological components cross the boundary areas at different stages to complete the life-history cycle. While the "Bakun triad" of factors responsible for the development of large pelagic fish populations (enrichment, concentration and retention) provide an important unifying principle for understanding the compromise implicit in adaptation to upwelling systems, the role of predation has been neglected, as has the fish yield relative to photosynthesis. The role global climate change will have in the Benguela in terms of shifting boundaries or weakening or intensifying gradients is being explored. The interannual and decadal signals are so strong in the region that long term trends are difficult to distinguish. Intensive resource utilisation and the collapse of several fish stocks occurred in the Benguela region during the 1960s and 1970s, with different recovery trajectories in the north and the south. The Angolan subsystem can be described as a subtropical transition zone between the wind-driven upwelling system and the Equatorial Atlantic, with gentle upwelling-favourable winds, well-defined seasons, intermediate productivity and moderate, declining fisheries. It is separated from the Namibian subsystem by the Angola-Benguela front. The northern Benguela shelf is a typical coastal upwelling system with equatorward winds, cool water, high plankton biomass and moderate to high fish biomass, which is currently in a depleted state. A shift from sardines to horse mackerel occurred during the period 1970-1990, while hake have never fully recovered from intensive fishing pressure up to 1990. Widespread oxygen-depleted waters and sulphur eruptions result from local and remote forcing, restricting the habitat available for pelagic and demersal fish species. The Luderitz-Orange River Cone is an intensive perennial upwelling cell where strong winds, high turbulence and strong offshore transport constitute a partial barrier to epipelagic fish species. Upwelling source water alters in salinity and oxygen, across this boundary zone. A decline in upwelling-favourable winds occurred between 1990 and 2005. The southern Benguela region is characterised by a pulsed, seasonal, wind-driven upwelling at discrete centres and warm Agulhas water offshore. High primary productivity forms a belt of enrichment along the coast, constrained by a front. Low-oxygen water, which only occurs close inshore, may adversely affect some resources. The west coast is primarily a nursery ground for several fish species which spawn on the Agulhas Bank and are transported by alongshore jet currents to the west coast. The Agulhas Bank forms the southern boundary of the Benguela system and it displays characteristics of both an upwelling and a temperate shallow shelf system, with seasonal stratification and mixing, coastal, shelf-edge and dynamic upwelling, moderate productivity and a well oxygenated shelf. A large biomass of fish occupies the Bank during the summer season, with some evidence for tight coupling between trophic levels. A cool ridge of upwelled water, with links to coastal upwelling and to the Agulhas Current, appears to play an important but poorly understood role affecting the distribution and productivity of pelagic fish. A boom in sardine and anchovy populations was accompanied by an eastward shift, followed by 5 years of poor recruitment by sardine but successful recruitment of anchovy, indicating changes in the early life-history patterns of these two species. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {In the Benguela upwelling system, the environmental conditions are determined to a large extent by central water masses advected from remote areas onto the shelf. The origin, spreading pathways and fate of those water masses are investigated with a regional ocean model that is analysed using Eulerian passive tracers and on the basis of Lagrangian trajectories. Two major water masses influencing the Benguela upwelling system are identified: tropical South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) and subtropical Eastern South Atlantic Central Water (ESACW). The spreading of tropical waters into the subtropical Benguela upwelling system is mediated by equatorial currents and their continuation in the Southeast Atlantic. This tropical-subtropical connection has been attributed to signal propagation in the equatorial and coastal waveguides. However, there exists an additional spreading path for tropical central water in the open ocean. This mass transport fluctuates on a seasonal scale around an averaged meridional transport in Sverdrup balance. The inter-annual variability of the advection of tropical waters is related to Benguela Niños, as evidenced by the 2010/ 2011 event. The northern Benguela upwelling system is a transition zone between SACW and ESACW since they encounter each other at about 20S. Both water masses have seasonal variable shares in the upwelled water there. To summarise the main pathways of central water mass transport, an enhanced scheme for the subsurface circulation in the Southeast Atlantic is presented.},

   abstract = {Equilibrium dynamics of the Benguela system is investigated using the holistic nature of the spatially and temporally cohesive output of a numerical model. The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is used to simulate the Benguela system in its entirety. It successfully simulates the cool coastal upwelling regime and its division into seven distinctly separate cells, as well as the large-scale offshore regime and the respective seasonal fluctuations. It does however, present a cool bias at the coast due to an underestimation of the coastal wind drop-off as well as a warm bias offshore in the southern Benguela due to the overestimation of Agulhas Current input. The Benguela can be divided into northern and southern regimes, based on dynamic as well as topographic differences. Topographically, the division between the northern and southern regimes coincides with an abrupt narrowing of the continental shelf toward the north at 28°S. The large-scale depth-integrated flow to the north of this feature is weak but distinctly poleward, while to the south the flow regime is governed by the meandering nature of the equatorward Benguela Current and is the pathway for eddies that originate at the Agulhas retroflection. The poleward flowing regime of the northern Benguela is tied to the Sverdrup relation, which links meridional transport with wind stress curl. The Lüderitz upwelling cell at 27°S experiences the most vigorous upwelling throughout the year and, as a result, offshore volume fluxes in this region are extremely large. This upwelling cell divides the northern and southern Benguela coastal upwelling systems into separate regimes, based on the fact that their seasonal signals are out of phase. The offshore gradient of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is generally strong in the Benguela system and exceptionally so in the southern Benguela due to vigorous mesoscale activity offshore of the shelf-edge, originating from the Agulhas retroflection area. The juxtaposition between the steep offshore EKE gradients in the south and much weaker offshore gradients of EKE in the northern Benguela has different implications for cross-shore exchanges. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The site of origin of the Brazil Current (BC) is currently one of the less explored aspects of regional circulation and mesoscale activity in the west side of the South Atlantic Subtropical gyre. The few studies that are available, based either on in situ data or on numerical modeling, seems to agree that the region is characterized by relatively weak baroclinic flow, with substantial mesoscale activity, which is quite different from other western boundary current systems (e.g. Florida Current, in the North Atlantic). We present numerical simulations that show that the main realistic mesoscale features in the eddy-rich vicinities of the BC site of origin can be successfully modeled through the dynamical interaction between parameterized versions of two opposing mean western boundary currents (BC and North Brazil Undercurrent-NBUC) and local topography, with no influence of remote dynamics or atmospheric forcing. Large BC-related anticyclones observed in previous work were reproduced and recurrently formed during the model run. Two additional sensitivity experiments were performed. When NBUC is removed from the physical setting, the BC interaction with topography is not sufficient to generate eddies similar to observations. When an idealized flat-bottom and a physiographic configuration with no Abrolhos and Royal Charlotte Banks are considered, the BC-NBUC interaction is also not capable of developing realistic mesoscale structures. Our geophysical instability analyses suggest that BC-NBUC vertical shear is promoting baroclinic energy fluxes from the mean flow to the perturbations, resulting in eddy formation and growth in the region. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Previous climatological studies showed a stratified sSEC bifurcation and that the resulting southern branch formed a shallow BC - a weak western boundary current. The analysis of three recent synoptic surveys and global model outputs challenge the description of a continuous BC. The sSEC bifurcation signal near the continental margin was unclear in the analyses, and the velocity fields were dominated by mesoscale eddies. Recurrent anticyclones that seemed to be related to the meandering BC led us to construct a picture of a flow strongly influenced by topography and probably very unstable.

   abstract = {The circulation of the low-salinity Antarctic Intermediate Water in the South Atlantic and the associated dynamical processes are studied, using recent and historical hydrographic profiles. Lagrangian and Eulerian current measurements as well as wind stress observations. The circulation pattern inferred for the Antarctic Intermediate Water supports the hypothesis of an anticyclonic basinwide recirculation of the intermediate water in the subtropics. The eastward current of the intermediate anticyclone is fed mainly by water recirculated in the Brazil Current and by the Malvinas Current. An additional source region is the Polar Frontal zone of the South Atlantic. The transport in the meandering eastward current ranges from 6 to 26 Sv (Sv ≡ 106 m3 s-1). The transport of the comparably uniform westward flow of the gyre varies between 10 and 30 Sv. Both transports vary with longitude. At the western boundary near 28°S, in the Santos Bifurcation, the westward current splits into two branches. About three-quarters of the 19 Sv at 40°W go south as an intermediate western boundary current. The remaining quarter flows northward along the western boundary. Simulations with a simple model of the ventilated thermocline reveal that the wind-driven subtropical gyre has a vertical extent of over 1200 m. The transports derived from the simulations suggest that about 90% of the transport in the westward branch of the intermediate gyre and about 50% of the transport in the eastward branch can be attributed to the wind-driven circulation. The structure of the simulated gyre deviates from observations to some extent. The discrepancies between the simulations and the observations are most likely caused by the interoceanic exchange south of Africa, the dynamics of the boundary currents, the nonlinearity, and the seasonal variability of the wind field. A simulation with an inflow/outflow condition for the eastern boundary reduces the transport deviations in the eastward current to about 20%. The results support the hypothesis that the wind field is of major importance for the subtropical circulation of Antarctic Intermediate Water followed by the interoceanic exchange. The simulations suggest that the westward transport in the subtropical gyre undergoes seasonal variations. The transport and the structure of the intermediate subtropical gyre from the Parallel Ocean Climate Model (Semtner-Chervin model) agree better with observations.},

   abstract = {Abstract. The Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) at 34.5° S in the South Atlantic carries a significant fraction of the cold deep limb of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), and therefore its variability affects the meridional heat transport and consequently the regional and global climate. Nearly 6 years of observations from a line of pressure-equipped inverted echo sounders (PIESs) have yielded an unprecedented data set for studying the characteristics of the time-varying DWBC volume transport at 34.5° S. Furthermore, the horizontal resolution of the observing array was greatly improved in December 2012 with the addition of two current-and-pressure-equipped inverted echo sounders (CPIESs) at the midpoints of the two westernmost pairs of PIES moorings. Regular hydrographic sections along the PIES/CPIES line confirm the presence of recently ventilated North Atlantic Deep Water carried by the DWBC. The time-mean absolute geostrophic transport integrated within the DWBC layer, defined between 800–4800 dbar and within longitude bounds of 51.5 to 44.5° W, is −15 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1; negative indicates southward flow). The observed peak-to-peak range in volume transport using these integration limits is from −89 to +50 Sv, and the temporal standard deviation is 23 Sv. Testing different vertical integration limits based on time-mean water-mass property levels yields small changes to these values, but no significant alteration to the character of the transport time series. The time-mean southward DWBC flow at this latitude is confined west of 49.5° W, with recirculations dominating the flow further offshore. As with other latitudes where the DWBC has been observed for multiple years, the time variability greatly exceeds the time mean, suggesting the presence of strong coherent vortices and/or Rossby Wave-like signals propagating to the boundary from the interior.},

In the South Atlantic these pathways have been the subject of discussion for years, mostly due to the lack of observations. Knowledge of the pathways of the AMOC in the South Atlantic is a first order prerequisite for understanding the fluxes of climatically important properties. In this paper, historical and new observations, including hydrographic and oxygen sections, Argo data, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), are examined together with two different analyzes of the Ocean general circulation model For the Earth Simulator (OFES) to trace the pathway of the recently ventilated NADW through the South Atlantic. CLIVAR-era CFCs, oxygen and salinity clearly show that the strongest NADW pathway in the South Atlantic is along the western boundary (similar to the North Atlantic). In addition to the western boundary pathway, tracers show an eastward spreading of NADW between ~17 and 25°S. Analyzed together with the results of earlier studies, the observations and model output presented here indicate that after crossing the equator, the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) transports water with the characteristics of NADW and a total volume transport of approximately 14Sv (1Sv=106m3s-1). It crosses 5°S as a narrow western boundary current and becomes dominated by eddies further south. When this very energetic eddying flow reaches the Vitória-Trindade Ridge (~20°S), the flow follows two different pathways. The main portion of the NADW flow continues along the continental shelf of South America in the form of a strong reformed DWBC, while a smaller portion, about 22% of the initial transport, flows towards the interior of the basin.},

   abstract = {Abstract. The oceanic circulation over the southwestern Atlantic shelf is influenced by large tidal amplitudes, substantial freshwater discharges, high wind speeds and – most importantly – by its proximity to two of the largest western boundary currents of the world ocean: the Brazil and Malvinas currents. This review article aims to discriminate the dynamical processes controlling the interaction between this extensive shelf region and the deep-ocean. The discussion is focused on two broad regions: the South Brazil Bight to the north, and Patagonia to the south. The exchanges between the Brazil Current and the South Brazil Bight are characterized by the intermittent development of eddies and meanders of the Brazil Current at the shelfbreak. However, it is argued that this is not the only – nor the most important – influence of the Brazil Current on the shelf. Numerical simulations show that the thermohaline structure of the South Brazil Bight can be entirely ascribed to steady state, bottom boundary layer interactions between the shelf and the Brazil Current. The Malvinas Current does not show the development of eddies and meanders, but its influence on the Patagonian shelf is not less important. Models and observations indicate that the Malvinas Current not only controls the shelfbreak dynamics and cross-shelf exchanges but also influences the circulation in the shelf's interior.},

The Patagonia continental shelf located off southeastern South America is bounded offshore by the Malvinas Current, which extends northward from northern Drake Passage (~55° S) to nearly 38° S. The transition between relatively warm-fresh shelf waters and Subantarctic Waters from the western boundary current is characterized by a thermohaline front extending nearly 2500 km. We use satellite derived sea surface temperature, and chlorophyll-a data combined with hydrographic and surface drifter data to document the intrusions of slope waters onto the continental shelf near 41° S. These intrusions create vertically coherent localized negative temperature and positive salinity anomalies extending onshore about 150 km from the shelf break. The region is associated with a center of action of the first mode of non-seasonal sea surface temperature variability and also relatively high chlorophyll-a variability, suggesting that the intrusions are important in promoting the local development of phytoplankton. The generation of slope water penetrations at this location may be triggered by the inshore excursion of the 100 m isobath, which appears to steer the Malvinas Current waters over the outer shelf.},

Here, we provide a comprehensive description of the BMC based on physical and biogeochemical data – hydrographic stations, profiling floats and subsurface drifters – gathered in March 2015. We use these data in order to characterize the impinging and outflowing currents and to describe the cross- and along-frontal thermohaline structure. In addition, we compare the in-situ measurements with both climatological data and the Mercator Ocean eddy-resolving reanalysis. The hydrographic sections illustrate the contrasting properties between the two western boundary currents: warm, salty, nutrient- and oxygen-poor oligotrophic subtropical waters carried southward by the BC and the cold, fresh, oxygen- and nutrient-rich subantarctic waters carried northward by the MC. The frontal system is also characterized by the presence of thermohaline intrusions, with the cross-frontal gradients and along-front velocities sharpening as the colliding currents shape the frontal system. We also observe brackish waters spreading on top of the frontal jet as a result of both the confluence dynamics and off-shelf advection favored by north-easterly winds. These low-salinity waters are positively correlated with surface ageostrophic speeds over the frontal jet. The cruise data illustrates the high regional and mesoscale variability as compared with climatological conditions, and further document the submesoscale subsurface complexity, which is not properly captured by available operational models.},

   abstract = {Abstract. Atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are at unprecedented, record-high levels compared to the last 800 000 years. Those elevated GHG concentrations warm the planet and – partially offset by net cooling effects by aerosols – are largely responsible for the observed warming over the past 150 years. An accurate representation of GHG concentrations is hence important to understand and model recent climate change. So far, community efforts to create composite datasets of GHG concentrations with seasonal and latitudinal information have focused on marine boundary layer conditions and recent trends since the 1980s. Here, we provide consolidated datasets of historical atmospheric concentrations (mole fractions) of 43 GHGs to be used in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project – Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments. The presented datasets are based on AGAGE and NOAA networks, firn and ice core data, and archived air data, and a large set of published studies. In contrast to previous intercomparisons, the new datasets are latitudinally resolved and include seasonality. We focus on the period 1850–2014 for historical CMIP6 runs, but data are also provided for the last 2000 years. We provide consolidated datasets in various spatiotemporal resolutions for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as 40 other GHGs, namely 17 ozone-depleting substances, 11 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 9 perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). In addition, we provide three equivalence species that aggregate concentrations of GHGs other than CO2, CH4 and N2O, weighted by their radiative forcing efficiencies. For the year 1850, which is used for pre-industrial control runs, we estimate annual global-mean surface concentrations of CO2 at 284.3 ppm, CH4 at 808.2 ppb and N2O at 273.0 ppb. The data are available at https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/input4mips/ and http://www.climatecollege.unimelb.edu.au/cmip6. While the minimum CMIP6 recommendation is to use the global- and annual-mean time series, modelling groups can also choose our monthly and latitudinally resolved concentrations, which imply a stronger radiative forcing in the Northern Hemisphere winter (due to the latitudinal gradient and seasonality).},

   abstract = {ECHAM6, the sixth generation of the atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM, is described. Major changes with respect to its predecessor affect the representation of shortwave radiative transfer, the height of the model top. Minor changes have been made to model tuning and convective triggering. Several model configurations, differing in horizontal and vertical resolution, are compared. As horizontal resolution is increased beyond T63, the simulated climate improves but changes are incremental; major biases appear to be limited by the parameterization of small-scale physical processes, such as clouds and convection. Higher vertical resolution in the middle atmosphere leads to a systematic reduction in temperature biases in the upper troposphere, and a better representation of the middle atmosphere and its modes of variability. ECHAM6 represents the present climate as well as, or better than, its predecessor. The most marked improvements are evident in the circulation of the extratropics. ECHAM6 continues to have a good representation of tropical variability. A number of biases, however, remain. These include a poor representation of low-level clouds, systematic shifts in major precipitation features, biases in the partitioning of precipitation between land and sea (particularly in the tropics), and midlatitude jets that appear to be insufficiently poleward. The response of ECHAM6 to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is similar to that of ECHAM5. The equilibrium climate sensitivity of the mixed-resolution (T63L95) configuration is between 2.9 and 3.4 K and is somewhat larger for the 47 level model. Cloud feedbacks and adjustments contribute positively to warming from increasing greenhouse gases. ©2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

   abstract = {The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a key role in the global climate system through its redistribution of heat. Changes in the AMOC have been associated with large fluctuations in the earth's climate in the past and projections of AMOC decline in the future due to climate change motivate the continuous monitoring of the circulation. Since 2004, the RAPID monitoring array has been providing continuous estimates of the AMOC and associated heat transport at 26°N in the North Atlantic. We describe how these measurements are made including the sampling strategy, the accuracies of parameters measured and the calculation of the AMOC. The strength of the AMOC and meridional heat transport are estimated as 17.2. Sv and 1.25. PW respectively from April 2004 to October 2012. The accuracy of ten day (annual) transports is 1.5. Sv (0.9. Sv). Improvements to the estimation of the transport above the shallowest instruments and deepest transports (including Antarctic Bottom Water), and the use of the new equation of state for seawater have reduced the estimated strength of the AMOC by 0.6. Sv relative to previous publications. As new basinwide AMOC monitoring projects begin in the South Atlantic and sub-polar North Atlantic, we present this thorough review of the methods and measurements of the original AMOC monitoring array.},

   abstract = {A hierarchy of global 1=4° (ORCA025) and Atlantic Ocean 1=20° nested (VIKING20X) ocean-sea-ice models is described. It is shown that the eddy-rich configurations performed in hindcasts of the past 50-60 years under CORE and JRA55-do atmospheric forcings realistically simulate the large-scale horizontal circulation, the distribution of the mesoscale, overflow and convective processes, and the representation of regional current systems in the North and South Atlantic. The representation of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and in particular the long-term temporal evolution, strongly depends on numerical choices for the application of freshwater fluxes. The interannual variability of the AMOC instead is highly correlated among the model experiments and also with observations, including the 2010 minimum observed by RAPID at 26.5° N. This points to a dominant role of the wind forcing. The ability of the model to represent regional observations in western boundary current (WBC) systems at 53° N, 26.5° N and 11° S is explored. The question is investigated of whether WBC systems are able to represent the AMOC, and in particular whether these WBC systems exhibit similar temporal evolution to that of the zonally integrated AMOC. Apart from the basin-scale measurements at 26.5° N, it is shown that in particular the outflow of North Atlantic Deepwater at 53° N is a good indicator of the subpolar AMOC trend during the recent decades, once provided in density coordinates. The good reproduction of observed AMOC and WBC trends in the most reasonable simulations indicate that the eddyrich VIKING20X is capable of representing realistic forcingrelated and ocean-intrinsic trends.},

We present a time series for AMOC strength over the last 120 years which is derived solely from observations. Application of the Bernoulli inverse to hydrography yields the general geostrophic circulation in the North Atlantic without requiring additional sea surface height information, allowing AMOC evaluation in the pre-satellite era. AMOC varies on a multidecadal timescale, leading the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) in sea surface temperature by 2.5 years. We consider the dynamics of the implied AMOC/AMV coupling, and hypothesize that the low-frequency variability in both parameters is driven by large-scale density anomalies circulating in the AMOC.},

   abstract = {Oceanic eddies are an important component in preconditioning the central Labrador Sea (LS) for deep convection and in restratifying the convected water. This study investigates the different sources and impacts of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and its temporal variability in the LS with the help of a 52-yr-long hindcast simulation of a 1/20° ocean model. Irminger Rings (IR) are generated in the West Greenland Current (WGC) between 60° and 62°N, mainly affect preconditioning, and limit the northward extent of the convection area. The IR exhibit a seasonal cycle and decadal variations linked to the WGC strength, varying with the circulation of the subpolar gyre. The mean and temporal variations of IR generation can be attributed to changes in deep ocean baroclinic and upper-ocean barotropic instabilities at comparable magnitudes. The main source of EKE and restratification in the central LS are convective eddies (CE). They are generated by baroclinic instabilities near the bottom of the mixed layer during and after convection. The CE have a middepth core and reflect the hydrographic properties of the convected water mass with a distinct minimum in potential vorticity. Their seasonal to decadal variability is tightly connected to the local atmospheric forcing and the associated air–sea heat fluxes. A third class of eddies in the LS are the boundary current eddies shed from the Labrador Current (LC). Since they are mostly confined to the vicinity of the LC, these eddies appear to exert only minor influence on preconditioning and restratification.},

   abstract = {A transbasin monitoring array from Labrador to Scotland was deployed in the summer of 2014 as part of the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP). The aim of the observing system is to provide a multiyear continuous measure of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and the associated meridional heat and freshwater transports in the subpolar North Atlantic. Results from the array are expected to improve the understanding of the variability of the subpolar transports and the nature and degree of the AMOC’s latitudinal dependence. In this present work, the measurements of the OSNAP array are described and a suite of observing system simulation experiments in an eddy-permitting numerical model are used to assess how well these measurements will estimate the fluxes across the OSNAP section. The simulation experiments indicate that the OSNAP array and calculation methods will adequately capture the mean and temporal variability of the overturning circulation and of the heat and freshwater transports across the subpolar North Atlantic.},

   abstract = {The Atlantic Ocean overturning circulation is important to the climate system because it carries heat and carbon northward, and from the surface to the deep ocean. The high salinity of the subpolar North Atlantic is a prerequisite for overturning circulation, and strong freshening could herald a slowdown. We show that the eastern subpolar North Atlantic underwent extreme freshening during 2012 to 2016, with a magnitude never seen before in 120 years of measurements. The cause was unusual winter wind patterns driving major changes in ocean circulation, including slowing of the North Atlantic Current and diversion of Arctic freshwater from the western boundary into the eastern basins. We find that wind-driven routing of Arctic-origin freshwater intimately links conditions on the North West Atlantic shelf and slope region with the eastern subpolar basins. This reveals the importance of atmospheric forcing of intra-basin circulation in determining the salinity of the subpolar North Atlantic.},

   abstract = {Subtropical underwater (STUW) and its year-to-year variability in annual subduction rate are investigated using recently available Argo data in the North Atlantic. For the period of observation (2002–14), the mean annual subduction rate of the STUW is 7.3 ± 1.2 Sv (1 Sv = 10 6 m 3 s −1 ) within the density range between 25.0 and 26.0 kg m −3 . Once subducted, the STUW spreads in the subtropical gyre as a vertical salinity maximum. In the mean, the spatial changes in temperature and salinity of the STUW tend to compensate each other, and the density of the water mass remains rather stable near 25.5 kg m −3 in the southwestern part of the subtropical gyre. The annual subduction rate of the STUW varies from year to year, and most of this variability is due to lateral induction, which in turn is directly linked to the variability of the winter mixed layer depth. Through modulation of surface buoyancy, wind anomalies associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation are primarily responsible for this variability. Sea surface salinity anomalies in the formation region of the STUW are conveyed into the thermocline, but their westward propagation cannot be detected by the present data.},

In 2009-2010, abrupt warming prompted an ecosystem shift with consequences for fisheries, yet the cause of this event is unclear. Here we use satellite altimetry and in situ measurements to show that, in 2008, the Gulf Stream migrated closer to the Tail of the Grand Banks, a shift that has persisted ever since. This change reduced the westward connectivity of the Labrador Current that otherwise supplies cold, fresh, oxygen-rich waters to the shelf. Within one year after the appearance of anomalously warm and saline water at the Tail of Grand Banks, subsurface warming progressed south-westwards. Historical observations suggest a similar sequence of events may have occurred in the 1970s. Therefore, monitoring water properties at the Tail of Grand Banks may offer predictability for shelf properties and ecosystem perturbations with substantial lead time.},

The results demonstrate that barotropic and baroclinic signals at both boundaries cause significant transport variations, and as such must be concurrently observed. The data, spanning ~20 months during 2009–2010 and ~4 years during 2013–2017, reveal a highly energetic MOC record with a temporal standard deviation of 8.3 Sv, and strong variations at time scales ranging from a few days to years (peak-to-peak range = 54.6 Sv). Seasonal transport variations are found to have both semiannual (baroclinic) and annual (Ekman and barotropic) timescales. Interannual MOC variations result from both barotropic and baroclinic changes, with density profile changes at the eastern boundary having the largest impact on the year-to-year variations.},

   abstract = {Data from two boundary arrays deployed along 34.5°S are combined to produce the first continuous in situ time series observations of the basin-wide meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the South Atlantic. Daily estimates of the MOC between March 2009 and December 2010 range between 3 Sv and 39 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s-1) after a 10 day low-pass filter is applied. Much of the variability in this ∼20 month record occurs at periods shorter than 100 days. Approximately two-thirds of the MOC variability is due to changes in the geostrophic (baroclinic plus barotropic) volume transport, with the remainder associated with the direct wind-forced Ekman transport. When low-pass filtered to match previously published analyses in the North Atlantic, the observed temporal standard deviation at 34.5°S matches or somewhat exceeds that observed by time series observations at 16°N, 26.5°N, and 41°N. For periods shorter than 20 days the basin-wide MOC variations are most strongly influenced by Ekman flows, while at periods between 20 and 90 days the geostrophic flows tend to exert slightly more control over the total transport variability of the MOC. The geostrophic shear variations are roughly equally controlled by density variations on the western and eastern boundaries at all time scales captured in the record. The observed time-mean MOC vertical structure and temporal variability agree well with the limited independent observations available for confirmation. Key Points The MOC at 34.5S is highly variable, with a range of 30+ Sv during ~20 months MOC variations at 34.5S occur at periods ranging from a few days to a few months MOC estimates from the PIES moorings agree well with existing validation data © 2013.

   abstract = {The international Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) defined the enthalpy and entropy of seawater, thus enabling the global ocean heat content to be calculated as the volume integral of the product of in situ density, ρ, and potential enthalpy, h0 (with reference sea pressure of 0 dbar). In terms of Conservative Temperature, Θ, ocean heat content is the volume integral of ρc0pΘ, where c0pis a constant "isobaric heat capacity". However, many ocean models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) as well as all models that contributed to earlier phases, such as CMIP5, CMIP3, CMIP2, and CMIP1, used EOS-80 (Equation of State - 1980) rather than the updated TEOS-10, so the question arises of how the salinity and temperature variables in these models should be physically interpreted, with a particular focus on comparison to TEOS-10-compliant observations. In this article we address how heat content, surface heat fluxes, and the meridional heat transport are best calculated using output from these models and how these quantities should be compared with those calculated from corresponding observations. We conclude that even though a model uses the EOS- 80, which expects potential temperature as its input temperature, the most appropriate interpretation of the model's temperature variable is actually Conservative Temperature. This perhaps unexpected interpretation is needed to ensure that the air-sea heat flux that leaves and arrives in atmosphere and sea ice models is the same as that which arrives in and leaves the ocean model. We also show that the salinity variable carried by present TEOS-10-based models is Preformed Salinity, while the salinity variable of EOS-80-based models is also proportional to Preformed Salinity. These interpretations of the salinity and temperature variables in ocean models are an update on the comprehensive Griffies et al. (2016) paper that discusses the interpretation of many aspects of coupled Earth system models.},

   abstract = {The equation of state of seawater (EOS) provides a simple way to link the properties of seawater that are the most important for ocean dynamics and the ocean-atmosphere climate system. In 2010, the set of equations used to derive all thermodynamic properties of seawater were updated using a thermodynamic approach. The new approach, named TEOS-10, results in better estimates of seawater properties, such as salinity and temperature, when compared to the previous EOS version (EOS-80). Since several physical processes in the oceans are driven by these properties, improvements in the EOS performance are expected to lead to a better and more realistic representation of the ocean. This work focuses on assessing the main differences of the: (i) contribution of water masses to a total mixture, (ii) baroclinic velocity, and (iii) volume and heat transport, as calculated by the EOS-80 and by the TEOS-10, along four zonal transects at 26.5°N, 10°N, 11°S, and 34.5°S in the Atlantic Ocean. The density differences (always between TEOS-10 and EOS-80) increase with depth and hence the results indicate that the most significant difference in the water mass contributions was found for Antarctic Bottom Water. Within that layer, the differences reach up to 10% on its fraction of the mixture when calculated by the TEOS-10, although the difference in the North Atlantic Deep Water contribution was not negligible either. The estimated baroclinic velocities showed considerable differences in all studied areas, being more significant over boundary current systems. The Gulf Stream presented lower velocity, while the Brazil Current presented increasing velocity when using TEOS-10.

   abstract = {Marine plastic debris floating on the ocean surface is a major environmental problem. However, its distribution in the ocean is poorly mapped, and most of the plastic waste estimated to have entered the ocean from land is unaccounted for. Better understanding of how plastic debris is transported from coastal and marine sources is crucial to quantify and close the global inventory of marine plastics, which in turn represents critical information for mitigation or policy strategies. At the same time, plastic is a unique tracer that provides an opportunity to learn more about the physics and dynamics of our ocean across multiple scales, from the Ekman convergence in basin-scale gyres to individual waves in the surfzone. In this review, we comprehensively discuss what is known about the different processes that govern the transport of floating marine plastic debris in both the open ocean and the coastal zones, based on the published literature and referring to insights from neighbouring fields such as oil spill dispersion, marine safety recovery, plankton connectivity, and others. We discuss how measurements of marine plastics (both in situ and in the laboratory), remote sensing, and numerical simulations can elucidate these processes and their interactions across spatio-temporal scales.},

In the Lagrangian approach, large sets of virtual particles are integrated within the three-dimensional, time-evolving velocity fields. Over several decades, a variety of tools and methods for this purpose have emerged. Here, we review the state of the art in the field of Lagrangian analysis of ocean velocity data, starting from a fundamental kinematic framework and with a focus on large-scale open ocean applications. Beyond the use of explicit velocity fields, we consider the influence of unresolved physics and dynamics on particle trajectories. We comprehensively list and discuss the tools currently available for tracking virtual particles. We then showcase some of the innovative applications of trajectory data, and conclude with some open questions and an outlook. The overall goal of this review paper is to reconcile some of the different techniques and methods in Lagrangian ocean analysis, while recognising the rich diversity of codes that have and continue to emerge, and the challenges of the coming age of petascale computing.},

   abstract = {The ocean area south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) frontal system is a region of major watermass modification. Influx of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), small-scale mixing, eddy transport and diffusion, as well as the fluxes of momentum and buoyancy at the sea surface combine in a complex array of processes to generate the unique stratification of the Southern Ocean with its southward uprising isopycnals and northward flux of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and Antarctic Bottom Water. Comprehensive analytical models of this scenario are rare. The authors develop and apply a model based on zonally and temporally averaged theory to explain the conversion of NADW into AAIW with all of the aforementioned processes contained in an extremely simplified way. Eddies appear via a transformed Eulerian mean (TEM) approach with a conventional downgradient parameterization of the meridional density flux. The structure of the eddy coefficient is estimated from hydrographic and wind stress data by a simple inverse approach. Mixing is limited to a near-surface layer and is treated in a most simple entrainment form. The model determines the zonal mean density stratification in the Southern Ocean and the baroclinic transport of the ACC from the applied wind stress and the surface density flux and unravels the role and importance of the different processes responsible for shaping the stratification (Ekman and eddy-induced advection and pumping, mixing, surface buoyancy flux, and eddy-induced diffusion). All of these processes must be present to yield an agreement between the simulated stratification and the observed one, but details of their parameterization might not be too critical. The ACC transport is shown to have a contribution forced by the local wind stress as well as another contribution relating to the nonlocal forcing by wind stress and density flux over the entire Antarctic zone. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Abstract. A decline in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength has been observed between 2004 and 2012 by the RAPID-MOCHA-WBTS (RAPID – Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array – Western Boundary Time Series, hereafter RAPID array) with this weakened state of the AMOC persisting until 2017. Climate model and paleo-oceanographic research suggests that the AMOC may have been declining for decades or even centuries before this; however direct observations are sparse prior to 2004, giving only “snapshots” of the overturning circulation. Previous studies have used linear models based on upper-layer temperature anomalies to extend AMOC estimates back in time; however these ignore changes in the deep circulation that are beginning to emerge in the observations of AMOC decline. Here we develop a higher-fidelity empirical model of AMOC variability based on RAPID data and associated physically with changes in thickness of the persistent upper, intermediate, and deep water masses at 26∘ N and associated transports. We applied historical hydrographic data to the empirical model to create an AMOC time series extending from 1981 to 2016. Increasing the resolution of the observed AMOC to approximately annual shows multi-annual variability in agreement with RAPID observations and shows that the downturn between 2008 and 2012 was the weakest AMOC since the mid-1980s. However, the time series shows no overall AMOC decline as indicated by other proxies and high-resolution climate models. Our results reinforce that adequately capturing changes to the deep circulation is key to detecting any anthropogenic climate-change-related AMOC decline.},

As a consequence temperatures of the Arctic basins at 200-800 m depth have increased considerably in comparison to earlier decades. The warm inflow pulses also had a low density. Owing to the decadal time scale of the circulation in the Atlantic Water Layer large pools of anomalously light water have thereby formed in the Arctic Ocean. These will slowly drain back south into the Nordic Seas. We submit that they will be able to influence the overflows into the Atlantic across the Greenland-Scotland ridges. The Atlantic meridional overturning is fed by these overflows. Our model experiments indicate that the low-density anomalies from the Arctic Ocean may be able to reduce the Denmark Strait overflow 15-25 years after the entrance of the original signal through Fram Strait into the Arctic Ocean. The actual size of the reduction depends on the exact path and speed of the anomalies inside the Arctic proper and on local processes in the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Sea.

Caesar et al. 1 argue that an AMOC slowdown started in the nineteenth century and intensified during the mid-twentieth century. Although the argument and selected evidence proposed have some merits, we find that their conclusions might be different if a more complete array of data available in the North Atlantic region is considered. We argue that the strength of AMOC over recent centuries is still poorly constrained and the expected slowdown may not have started yet. Recently, Moffa-Sánchez et al. 2 compiled a comprehensive set of palaeoclimate proxy data from the North Atlantic and Arctic regions using objective criteria to identify high-quality datasets of ocean conditions that span the past two millennia (Fig. 1). Although no direct (singular) proxy for AMOC exists, the palaeoceanographic proxy data compiled by Moffa-Sánchez et al. 2 highlight the spatial and temporal complexities of the ocean state in modern times and the recent past. When all the available proxy records potentially related to AMOC variability and twentieth century observational datasets are considered, the time history of the AMOC system becomes less certain. In contrast, selecting only a subset of proxy records that share similar trends, as performed by Caesar et al. 1 , provides an incomplete perspective on AMOC changes through time. Increased data availability in recent decades has enabled a shift in the fields of palaeoceanography and palaeoclimatology towards more objective and transparent data selections in studies aimed at quantitatively reconstructing past variability. Such screening methods tend to minimize the impact of spurious or less reliable records on analyses, and work to enhance the common signal in proxy records. Additionally, analysing networks of suitable and carefully selected data enables robust uncertainty estimates on the resulting reconstructions, which is essential to provide confidence in the results and the ability to compare information across disciplines. Key to such work is identifying robust criteria and weighting schemes that objectively identify and utilize the most reliable data. Caesar et al. 1 use a variety of proxy records in their analysis, but do not identify the reasoning or criteria for selecting those records over many others that are probably related to aspects of AMOC dynamics (see the recent review 2). Objective and inclusive data selection standards are especially important when addressing AMOC, which is a system composed of many different components that can behave differently at different latitudes, depths and timescales 3 , and looking at any singular index of AMOC inherently oversimplifies the system. The complex signals in the available AMOC-related proxy variables over recent centuries support this notion 2 , although many of these studies were not considered by Caesar et al. 1. In addition to the need for objective standards, we argue that most of the records compiled in the Caesar et al. article 1 have substantial caveats that were not discussed. Reconstructing the strength of AMOC more than a few decades ago relies on palaeoclimate and palaeoceanographic proxies because direct measurements are unavailable. Some proxies are more directly related to components of AMOC variability than others, and some sites are better situated to record specific oceanographic and atmospheric processes than others. The limited scope of data utilized combined with the inherent uncertainties in the proxies and conflicting evidence from other sources leaves the question open as to whether the available evidence supports the conclusion that AMOC is currently undergoing an unprecedented shift and/or weakening. Key information and rationale about the records included are lacking in Caesar et al. 1. For example, the Rahmstorf et al. 4 AMOC reconstruction used by Caesar et al. 1 is based on the subpolar North Atlantic temperature minus the Northern Hemisphere mean temperature , each constructed from tree ring and ice core records, and a scaling coefficient derived from one climate model. These data are land-based estimates influenced by atmospheric conditions, not necessarily robust indicators of marine temperatures, and the resulting index is strongly impacted by the global warming signal 5.

The relative roles of diabatic and adiabatic processes in the volume and heat budgets of the subtropical gyre are in-vestigated by projecting data into temperature coordinates as volumes of water using an Argo-based climatology and an ocean state estimate (ECCO version 4). This highlights that variations in the subtropical gyre volume budget are predominantly set by transport divergence in the gyre. A strong corre-lation between the volume anomaly due to transport divergence and the variability of both thermocline depth and Ekman pumping over the gyre suggests that wind-driven heave drives transport anomalies at the gyre boundaries. This wind-driven heaving contributes significantly to variations in the heat content of the gyre, as do anomalies in the air–sea fluxes. The analysis presented suggests that wind forcing plays an important role in driving interannual variability in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and that this variability can be unraveled from spatially distributed hydrographic observations using the framework presented here.},

   abstract = {In the mid 1990s, the North Atlantic subpolar gyre has shown a dramatic warming event that has been thoroughly investigated from observations and numerical simulations. Some studies suggest that it was due to an interannual, wind-driven weakening and shrinking of the gyre that facilitated the penetration of warm Atlantic Water, the weakening of the gyre being attributed to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and in the East Atlantic Pattern, which are the two dominant modes of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic. However, other studies suggest that the warming event was due to a decadal, buoyancy-driven strengthening of the meridional overturning circulation and subsequent intensification of the poleward heat transport, in response to the positive NAO conditions of 1988-1995. To reconcile this discrepancy, the heat budget in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre is reconstructed from four ocean hindcast simulations sharing the same modelling platform but using different settings. The novelty of this work is the decomposition of the subpolar gyre into a western and an eastern subregion, which is motivated by water mass distribution around Reykjanes Ridge and by the fact that deep convection only occurs in the western subpolar gyre.In the western subpolar gyre, the 1995 warming event is the decadal, baroclinic ocean response to positive NAO conditions from 1988 to 1995. The latter induced increased surface heat loss in the Labrador Sea that intensified deep convection hence strengthened the meridional overturning circulation and the associated poleward heat transport. In the eastern subregion, a concomittant warming is induced by an interannual, barotropic adjustment of the gyre circulation to an abrupt switch from positive NAO conditions in winter 1995 to negative NAO conditions in winter 1996. Indeed, the gyre response to negative NAO conditions is a cyclonic intergyre-gyre that increases northward volume and heat transports at the southeastern limit of the subpolar gyre. Therefore, the discrepancies found in the literature about the 1995 warming event of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre are reconciled in the present work, which suggests that the atmospheric drivers, the mechanisms at stake and the associated timescales are different to the east and to the west of Reykjanes Ridge.},

   abstract = {The anomalous decadal warming of the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean (SPNA), and the northward spreading of this warm water, has been linked to rapid Arctic sea ice loss and more frequent cold European winters. Recently, variations in this heat transport have also been reported to covary with global warming slowdown/acceleration periods via a Pacific climate response. We here examine the role of SPNA temperature variability in this Atlantic-Pacific climate connectivity. We find that the evolution of ocean heat content anomalies from the subtropics to the subpolar region, likely due to ocean circulation changes, coincides with a basin-wide Atlantic warming/cooling. This induces an Atlantic-Pacific sea surface temperature seesaw, which in turn, strengthens/weakens the Walker circulation and amplifies the Pacific decadal variability that triggers pronounced global-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies. We conclude that the decadal oceanic variability in the SPNA is an essential component of the tropical interactions between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.},

   abstract = {Continuous observations of ocean circulation at 26°N in the subtropical Atlantic Ocean have been made since April 2004 to quantify the strength and variability in the Atlantic Meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), in which warm, upper waters flow northward and colder deep waters below 1100 m depth return southward. The principal components of the AMOC are northward western boundary current transport in the Gulf Stream and Antilles Current, northward surface Ekman transport and southward thermocline recirculation, all of which are generally considered to be part of the wind-driven circulation. Southward flowing deep waters below 1100 m depth are usually considered to represent the buoyancy-driven circulation. We argue that the Gulf Stream is partially wind-driven but also partially buoyancy-driven as it returns upper waters upwelled in the global ocean back to water mass formation regions in the northern Atlantic. Seasonal to interannual variations in the circulation at 26°N are principally wind-driven. Variability in the buoyancy-driven circulation occurred in a sharp reduction in 2009 in the southward flow of Lower North Atlantic Deep Water when its transport decreased by 30% from pre-2009 values. Over the 14-year observational period from 2004 to 2018, the AMOC declined by 2.4 Sv from 18.3 to 15.9 Sv.},

There is strong observational and modeling evidence that multidecadal AMOC variability is a crucial driver of the observed AMV and associated climate impacts and an important source of enhanced decadal predictability and prediction skill. The AMOC-AMV linkage is consistent with observed key elements of AMV. Furthermore, this synthesis also points to a leading role of the AMOC in a range of AMV-related climate phenomena having enormous societal and economic implications, for example, Intertropical Convergence Zone shifts; Sahel and Indian monsoons; Atlantic hurricanes; El Niño–Southern Oscillation; Pacific Decadal Variability; North Atlantic Oscillation; climate over Europe, North America, and Asia; Arctic sea ice and surface air temperature; and hemispheric-scale surface temperature. Paleoclimate evidence indicates that a similar linkage between multidecadal AMOC variability and AMV and many associated climate impacts may also have existed in the preindustrial era, that AMV has enhanced multidecadal power significantly above a red noise background, and that AMV is not primarily driven by external forcing. The role of the AMOC in AMV and associated climate impacts has been underestimated in most state-of-the-art climate models, posing significant challenges but also great opportunities for substantial future improvements in understanding and predicting AMV and associated climate impacts.},

   abstract = {The cyclonic circulation of the Atlantic subpolar gyre is a key mechanism for North Atlantic climate variability on a wide range of time scales. It is generally accepted that it is driven by both cyclonic winds and buoyancy forcing, yet the individual importance and dynamical interactions of the two contributions remain unclear. The authors propose a simplified four-box model representing the convective basin of the Labrador Sea and its shallow and deep boundary current system, the western subpolar gyre. Convective heat loss drives a baroclinic flow of relatively light water around the dense center. Eddy salt flux from the boundary current to the center increases with a stronger circulation, favors the formation of dense waters, and thereby sustains a strong baroclinic flow, approximately 10%-25% of the total. In contrast, when the baroclinic flow is not active, surface waters may be too fresh to convect, and a buoyancy-driven circulation cannot develop. This situation corresponds to a second stable circulation mode. A hysteresis is found for variations in surface freshwater flux and the salinity of the near-surface boundary current. An analytical solution is presented and analyzed. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Despite the complexity of the global ocean system, numerous attempts have been made to scale the strength of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), principally in the North Atlantic, with large-scale, basin-wide hydrographic properties. In particular, various approaches to scaling the MOC with meridional density gradients have been proposed, but the success of these has only been demonstrated under limited conditions. Here we present a scaling relationship linking overturning to twice vertically-integrated meridional density gradients via the hydrostatic equation and a “rotated” form of the geostrophic equation. This provides a meridional overturning streamfunction as a function of depth for each basin. Using a series of periodically forced experiments in a global, coarse resolution configuration of the general circulation model NEMO, we explore the timescales over which this scaling is temporally valid. We find that the scaling holds well in the upper Atlantic cell (at 1000 m) for multi-decadal (and longer) timescales, accurately reconstructing the relative magnitude of the response for different frequencies and explaining over 85 % of overturning variance on timescales of 64-2048 years. Despite the highly nonlinear response of the Antarctic cell in the abyssal Atlantic, between 76 and 94 % of the observed variability at 4000 m is reconstructed on timescales of 32 years (and longer). The scaling law is also applied in the Indo-Pacific. This analysis is extended to a higher resolution, stochastically forced simulation for which correlations of between 0.79 and 0.99 are obtained with upper Atlantic MOC variability on timescales >25 years. These results indicate that meridional density gradients and overturning are linked via meridional pressure gradients, and that both the strength and structure of the MOC can be reconstructed from hydrography on multi-decadal and longer timescales provided that the link is made in this way.},

   abstract = {The latitudinal structure of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) variability in the North Atlantic is investigated using numerical results from three ocean circulation simulations over the past four to five decades. We show that AMOC variability south of the Labrador Sea (538N) to 258N can be decomposed into a latitudinally coherent component and a gyre-opposing component. The latitudinally coherent component contains both decadal and interannual variabilities. The coherent decadal AMOC variability originates in the subpolar region and is reflected by the zonal density gradient in that basin. It is further shown to be linked to persistent North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) conditions in all three models. The interannual AMOC variability contained in the latitudinally coherent component is shown to be driven by westerlies in the transition region between the subpolar and the subtropical gyre (408-508N), through significant responses in Ekman transport. Finally, the gyre-opposing component principally varies on interannual time scales and responds to local wind variability related to the annual NAO. The contribution of these components to the total AMOC variability is latitude-dependent: 1) in the subpolar region, all models show that the latitudinally coherent component dominates AMOC variability on interannual to decadal time scales, with little contribution from the gyre-opposing component, and 2) in the subtropical region, the gyre-opposing component explains a majority of the interannual AMOC variability in two models, while in the other model, the contributions from the coherent and the gyre-opposing components are comparable. These results provide a quantitative decomposition of AMOC variability across latitudes and shed light on the linkage between different AMOC variability components and atmospheric forcing mechanisms.},

   abstract = {The oceans’ role in climate and climate change is manifold. The Ocean circulation transports large amounts of heat and freshwater on hemispheric space scales which have significant impacts on regional climate in the ocean itself but also noticeable consequences via atmospheric teleconnections on land. Due to the high heat capacity of seawater and the relatively slow ocean circulation, the oceans provide a significant “memory” for the climate system. Bodies of water that descend from the sea surface may reside in the ocean interior for decades and centuries, while preserving their temperature and salinity signature, before they surface again to interact with the overlying atmosphere. The residence time of water in the atmosphere is about ten days and the persistence of dynamical states of the atmospheric circulation may last up to a few weeks. Thus, on long time scales ocean dynamics becomes important for climate, which implies that climate variations and climate change can only partially be understood without consideration of ocean dynamics and the intricate ocean-atmosphere interaction.},

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and its recent homologue, the Arctic Oscillation/Northern Hemisphere annular mode (AO/NAM), are the most prominent modes of variability in the Northern Hemisphere winter climate. The NAO teleconnection is characterised by a meridional displacement of atmospheric mass over the North Atlantic area. Its state is usually expressed by the standardised air pressure difference between the Azores High and the Iceland Low. ThisNAO index is a measure of the strength of the westerly flow (positive with strong westerlies, and vice versa). Together with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, the NAO is a major source of seasonal to interdecadal variability in the global atmosphere. On interannual and shorter time scales, the NAO dynamics can be explained as a purely internal mode of variability of the atmospheric circulation. Interdecadal variability maybe influenced, however, by ocean and sea-ice processes.},

Buoyancy forcing accounts for most of the decadal variability in both the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and the subpolar gyre circulation, and the key drivers of these basin-scale circulation changes are found to be the turbulent buoyancy fluxes: evaporation as well as the latent and sensible heat fluxes. These three fluxes account for almost all of the decadalAMOCvariability in the North Atlantic, even when applied only over the Labrador Sea region. Year-to-year changes in surface momentum forcing explain most of the interannual AMOC variability at all latitudes as well as most of the decadal variability south of the equator. The observed strengthening of Southern Ocean westerly winds accounts for much of the simulated AMOC variability between 308S and the equator but very little of the recent AMOC change in the North Atlantic. Ultimately, the strengthening of the North Atlantic overturning circulation between the 1970s and 1990s, which contributed to a pronounced SST increase at subpolar latitudes, is explained almost entirely by trends in the atmospheric surface state over the Labrador Sea. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

Both realistic experiments and idealized sensitivity studies with the model show a fast (intraseasonal timescale) barotropic response and a delayed (timescale about 6-8 yr) baroclinic oceanic response to the NAO. The fast response to a high NAO constitutes a barotropic anticyclonic circulation anomaly near the subpolar front with a substantial decrease of the northward heat transport and an increase of northward heat transport in the subtropics due to changes in Ekman transport. The delayed response is an increase in subpolar heat transport due to enhanced meridional overturning and due to a spinup of the subpolar gyre. The corresponding subpolar and subtropical heat content changes could in principle act as an immediate positive feedback and a delayed negative feedback to the NAO.},

It dictates climate variability from the eastern seaboard of the United States to Siberia and from the Arctic to the subtropical Atlantic, especially during boreal winter, so variations in the NAO are important to society and for the environment. Understanding the processes that govern this variability is, therefore, of high priority, especially in the context of global climate change. This review, aimed at a scientifically diverse audience, provides general background material for the other chapters in the monograph, and it synthesizes some of their central points. It begins with a description of the spatial structure of climate and climate variability, including how the NAO relates to other prominent patterns of atmospheric circulation variability. There is no unique way to define the spatial structure of the NAO, or thus its temporal evolution, but several common approaches are illustrated. The relationship between the NAO and variations in surface temperature, storms and precipitation, and thus the economy, as well as the ocean and ecosystem responses to NAO variability, are described. Although the NAO is a mode of variability internal to the atmosphere, indices of it exhibit decadal variability and trends. That not all of its variability can be attributed to intraseasonal stochastic atmospheric processes points to a role for external forcings and, perhaps, a small but useful amount of predictability. The surface, stratospheric and anthropogenic processes that may influence the phase and amplitude of the NAO are reviewed.},

Combining the data from earlier satellites, we find that subpolar circulation may have been weaker in the late 1990s than in the late 1970s and 1980s. Direct current-meter observations in the boundary current of the Labrador Sea support the weakening circulation trend of the 1990s and, together with hydrographic data, show that the mid- to late 1990s decline extends deep in the water column. Analysis of the local surface forcing suggests that the 1990s buoyancy forcing has a dynamic effect consistent with altimetric and hydrographic observations: A weak thermohaline forcing allows the decay of the domed structure of subpolar isopycnals and weakening of circulation.},

The origins of the interannual changes are discussed, covering three potential influencing factors:the propagation of anomalies developed upstream of the basin, the effect of local air-sea interaction, and the result of changes of regional circulation bringing different water masses into the region. The changes in heat and freshwater content of the upper ocean are directly compared to observed variations in air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes over the period of the time series. It is shown that the role of the atmosphere in locally altering the oceanic properties, particularly salinity, is relatively small and insufficient to explain the changes. Two recent hydrographic surveys are analyzed to ascertain how the distribution of water masses to the south of the basin may influence the properties of the northern Rockall Trough upper ocean, and the results are reviewed in the context of historical analyses. It is found that the critical factor in determining the properties is the varying amount of relatively cool and fresh North Atlantic Current water mixing with the dominant water mass, the warm saline Eastern North Atlantic Central Water at the entrance to the basin. Variations of inflowing water masses are caused by east-west changes in the location of the subpolar front, and the relationship of these changes in regional circulation to the North Atlantic wind stress field is discussed.},

This analysis shows three periods (1960s, around 1980, and 2000s) with enhanced warm, saline waters reaching high latitudes, alternating with freshwater events originating at high latitudes. It complements surface drifter and altimetry data showing the subtropical-subpolar exchange leading to a significant temperature and salinity increase in the northeast Atlantic after 2001. The warm water limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning cell represented by SODA expanded in density/salinity space during these warm events. Tracer simulations using SODA velocities also show decadal variation of the Gulf Stream waters reaching the subpolar gyre and Nordic seas. The negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation index, usually invoked in such variability, fails to predict the warming and salinization in the early 2000s, with salinities not seen since the 1960s. Wind stress curl variability provided a linkage to this subtropical/subpolar gyre exchange as illustrated using an idealized two-layer circulation model. The ocean response to the modulation of the climatological wind stress curl pattern was found to be such that the northward penetration of subtropical tracers is enhanced when amplitude of the wind stress curl is weaker than normal. In this case both the subtropical and subpolar gyres weaken and the subpolar density surfaces relax; hence, the polar front moves westward, opening an enhanced northward access of the subtropical waters in the eastern boundary current.

   abstract = {The physical processes determining the path of the Gulf Stream as it leaves the continental shelf of the USA are complex and involved. Understanding these processes is important to global climate studies because the Gulf Stream plays a major rôle in the distribution of heat in the northern hemisphere. Here we show that during the last 3 decades, the latitude of the Gulf Stream has been clearly correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); high values of the NAO index, which correspond to stronger westerly and trade winds, favouring more northerly paths of the Stream about 2 years later. The time-delay may be associated with the adjustment time of this part of the ocean circulation. If allowance is made for persistence of the Gulf Stream position from one year to the next, more than half the interannual variation in the position can be predicted.},

   abstract = {Observed patterns of wind stress curl and air-sea heat flux associated with the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) are used to discuss the response of ocean gyres and thermohaline circulation to NAO forcing and their possible feedback on the NAO. The observations motivate, and are interpreted in the framework of, a simple mathematical model that couples Ekman layers, ocean gyres, and thermohaline circulation to the atmospheric jet stream. Meridional shifts in the zero wind stress curl line are invoked to drive anomalies in ocean gyres, and north-south dipoles in air-sea flux drive anomalous thermohaline circulation. Both gyres and thermohaline circulation play a role in modulating sea surface temperature anomalies and hence, through air-sea interaction, the overlying jet stream. The model, which can be expressed in the form of a delayed oscillator with ocean gyres and/or thermohaline circulation providing the delay, identifies key nondimensional parameters that control whether the ocean responds passively to NAO forcing or actively couples. It suggests that both thermohaline circulation and ocean gyres can play a role in coupled interactions on decadal timescales.},

   abstract = {The Rapid instrument array across the Atlantic Ocean along 26° N provides unprecedentedmonitoring of the basin-scale circulation. A unique feature of the Rapid array is the combination of full-depth moorings with instruments measuring temperature, salinity, pressure time series at many depths with co-located bottom pressuremeasurements so that dynamic pressure can be measured from surface to bottom. Bottom pressure measurements show a zonally uniform rise (and fall) of bottom pressure of 0.015 dbar on a 5 to 10 day time scale, suggesting that the Atlantic basin is filling and draining on a short time scale. After removing the zonally uniform bottom pressure fluctuations, bottom pressure variations at 4000m depth against the western boundary compensate instantaneously for baroclinic fluctuations in the strength and structure of the deep western boundary current so there is no basin-scale mass imbalance resulting from variations in the deep western boundary current. After removing the mass compensating bottom pressure, residual bottom pressure fluctuations at the western boundary just east of the Bahamas balance variations in Gulf Stream transport. Again the compensation appears to be especially confined close to the western boundary. Thus, fluctuations in either Gulf Stream or deep western boundary current transports are compensated in a depth independent (barotropic) manner very close to the continental slope off the Bahamas. In contrast, compensation for variations in wind-driven surface Ekman transport appears to involve fluctuations in both western basin and eastern basin bottom pressures, though the bottom pressure difference fluctuations appear to be a factor of 3 too large, perhaps due to an inability to resolve small bottom pressure fluctuations after removal of larger zonal average, baroclinic, and Gulf Stream pressure components. For 4 tall moorings where time series dynamic height (geostrophic pressure) profiles can be estimated from sea surface to ocean bottom and bottom pressure can be added, there is no general correlation between surface dynamic height and bottom pressure. Dynamic height on each mooring is strongly correlated with sea surface height from satellite observations and the variability in both dynamic height and satellite sea surface height decrease sharply as the western boundary is approached. © Author(s) 2009.},

   abstract = {The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) makes the strongest oceanic contribution to the meridional redistribution of heat. Here, an observation-based, 48-month-long time series of the vertical structure and strength of the AMOC at 26.5°N is presented. From April 2004 to April 2008, the AMOC had a mean strength of 18.7±2.1 Sv (1 Sv≡106 m3 s-1)with fluctuations of 4.8 Sv rms. The best guess of the peak-to-peak amplitude of theAMOCseasonal cycle is 6.7 Sv, with a maximum strength in autumn and a minimum in spring. While seasonality in the AMOC was commonly thought to be dominated by the northward Ekman transport, this study reveals that fluctuations of the geostrophic midocean and Gulf Stream transports of 2.2 and 1.7 Sv rms, respectively, are substantially larger than those of the Ekman component (1.2 Sv rms). A simple model based on linear dynamics suggests that the seasonal cycle is dominated by wind stress curl forcing at the eastern boundary of the Atlantic. Seasonal geostrophic AMOC anomalies might represent an important and previously underestimated component of meridional transport and storage of heat in the subtropical North Atlantic. There is evidence that the seasonal cycle observed here is representative of much longer intervals. Previously, hydrographic snapshot estimates between 1957 and 2004 had suggested a longterm decline of the AMOC by 8 Sv. This study suggests that aliasing of seasonal AMOC anomalies might have accounted for a large part of the inferred slowdown. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

This could have significant ramifications for Atlantic Ocean heat transport, Arctic sea ice extent and regional North Atlantic climate. However, the potential for far-reaching effects, such as teleconnections to adjacent basins and into the Southern Hemisphere, remains unclear. Here, using a global climate model we show that AMOC collapse can accelerate the Pacific trade winds and Walker circulation by leaving an excess of heat in the tropical South Atlantic. This tropical warming drives anomalous atmospheric convection, resulting in enhanced subsidence over the east Pacific and a strengthened Walker circulation and trade winds. Further teleconnections include weakening of the Indian and South Atlantic subtropical highs and deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low. These findings have important implications for understanding the global climate response to ongoing greenhouse gas increases.},

   abstract = {We use an ocean general circulation model and its adjoint to analyze the causal chain linking sea surface buoyancy anomalies in the Labrador Sea to variability in the deep branch of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) on inter-annual timescales. Our study highlights the importance of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) for the north-to-south connectivity in the AMOC and for the meridional transport of Lower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW). We identify two mechanisms that allow the Labrador Sea to impact velocities in the LNADW layer. The first mechanism involves a passive advection of surface buoyancy anomalies from the Labrador Sea towards the eastern subpolar gyre by the background NAC. The second mechanism plays a dominant role and involves a dynamical response of the NAC to surface density anomalies originating in the Labrador Sea; the NAC adjustment modifies the northward transport of salt and heat and exerts a strong positive feedback, amplifying the upper ocean buoyancy anomalies. The two mechanisms spin up/down the subpolar gyre on a timescale of years, while boundary trapped waves rapidly communicate this signal to the subtropics and trigger an adjustment of LNADW transport on a timescale of months. The NAC and the eastern subpolar gyre play an essential role in both mechanisms linking the Labrador Sea with LNADW transport variability and the subtropical AMOC. We thus reconcile two apparently contradictory paradigms about AMOC connectivity: (1) Labrador Sea buoyancy anomalies drive AMOC variability; (2) water mass transformation is largest in the eastern subpolar gyre.},

Reconstruction of AMOC variability using Irminger Sea density shows strong control by the North Atlantic Oscillation on subpolar overturning on multiple time scales, achieved via the gyre circulation and waters from the Labrador Sea. Furthermore, the observed decrease of Irminger Sea density since the mid‐20th century (1950‐2019) is suggestive of a long‐term AMOC weakening of 2.2 Sv or 13%, however, this trend remains statistically insignificant due to the large interannual and decadal variability of the subpolar North Atlantic.},

Here, we propose a research community approach to implement the new paradigm through the integrated study of these BCPs in the World Ocean. The framework to investigate the BCPs combines measurements from different observational platforms, i.e., oceanographic ships, satellites, moorings, and robots (gliders, floats, and robotic surface vehicles such as wavegliders and saildrones). We describe the following aspects of the proposed research framework: variables and processes to be measured in both the euphotic and twilight zones for the different BCPs; spatial and temporal scales of occurrence of the various BCPs; selection of key regions for integrated studies of the BCPs; multi-platform observational strategies; and upscaling of results from regional observations to the global ocean using deterministic models combined with data assimilation and machine learning to make the most of the wealth of unique measurements. The proposed approach has the potential not only to bring together a large multidisciplinary community of researchers, but also to usher the community toward a new era of discoveries in ocean sciences.},

   abstract = {The Sverdrup circulation in the tropical Pacific is constructed from satellite scatterometer winds, compared with measured ocean currents, and diagnosed in an ocean GCM. Previous depictions of the Sverdrup circulation near the equator have shown only weak vertically integrated flows; here it is shown that the actual transports are not weak. This discrepancy could be due either to inaccuracies in the wind forcing or to Sverdrup dynamics being too simple in this region. Scatterometer winds show a strip of positive curl along the SST front north of the equator in the eastern Pacific that is due to wind speed changes induced by the front. Including that additional element of curl forcing greatly improves the realism of the Sverdrup representation, but the magnitudes of the equatorial transport are still too small by a factor of about 2. Although the nonlinear (advective and friction) terms are small in the model momentum balance, they are O(1) in the vorticity balance, especially because their meridional derivatives are large near the equator. Examining the effect of the nonlinear terms through the vorticity balance shows that advection acts to intensify the mean currents of the tropical Pacific, including both the Equatorial Undercurrent and the westward off-equatorial South Equatorial Current. However, the principal non-linearity is due to the acceleration and deceleration of the Equatorial Undercurrent, not to meridional convergence as has been previously argued.},

We focus on the formation and maintenance of subsurface equatorial currents in the Gulf of Guinea and we base our analysis on the evolution of potential vorticity (PV). We highlight the link between submesoscale processes (involving mixing, friction and filamentation), mesoscale vortices and the mean currents in the area. In the simulation, eastward currents, the South and North Equatorial Undercurrents (SEUC and NEUC respectively) and the Guinea Undercurrent (GUC), are shown to be linked to the westward currents located equatorward. We show that east of 20◦ W, both westward and eastward currents are associated with the spreading of PV tongues by mesoscale vortices. The Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) brings salty waters into the Gulf of Guinea. Mixing diffuses the salty anomaly downward. Meridional advection, mixing and friction are involved in the formation of fluid parcels with PV anomalies in the lower part and below the pycnocline, north and south of the EUC, in the Gulf of Guinea. These parcels gradually merge and vertically align, forming nonlinear anticyclonic vortices that propagate westward, spreading and horizontally mixing their PV content by stirring filamentation and diffusion, up to 20◦ W. When averaged over time, this creates regions of nearly homogeneous PV within zonal bands between 1.5◦ and 5◦ S or N. This mean PV field is associated with westward and eastward zonal jets flanking the EUC with the homogeneous PV tongues corresponding to the westward currents, and the strong PV gradient regions at their edges corresponding to the eastward currents. Mesoscale vortices strongly modulate the mean fields explaining the high spatial and temporal variability of the jets.},

The SSEC system is a key component of the western boundary supply, influencing the NBUC/BC variability and, therefore, global climate through the Meridional Overturning Circulation. In this study, using altimetry satellite data and reanalyzes outputs (1993–2018), we revisit the SSEC mean state and show this current arriving at the South Atlantic western boundary as a multi-banded flow with surface signatures resulting from different subsurface cores. These bands have velocities between 0.02 and 0.07 m s−1 and, as shown by ADCP data from the PIRATA project, their signature in synoptic scenarios is obscured by eddies and waves with velocities between 0.1 and 0.3 m s−1. In addition, the SSEC annual cycle analysis shows that the seasonality of the bands is out of phase with each other, presenting westward transport anomalies between 0.4 and 2.6 Sv. Finally, our results show that the seasonality of this multi-banded flow both defines where the BC is born, and modulates the seasonality of semi-permanent mesoscale eddies off Brazil.},

These alternating zonal flows, often called equatorial stacked jets, have amplitudes up to 20 cm s-1 and vertical wavelengths of 600 m. The jets are most pronounced in the depth range between 500 and 2500 m. Repeated direct velocity observations at 35°W indicate that the jets are coherent within ±1° of the equator. Individual jets can persist for 1-2 years, but they appear and decay rather irregularly. The equatorial stacked jets are also found in realistic general circulation model simulations. The features grow in amplitude with increasing horizontal and vertical model resolution. However, even at very high model resolutions, their amplitudes are still underestimated. In all model simulations, high levels of energy related to the stacked jets are found in the vicinity of the western boundary currents (WBCs). Depth range and strength of the WBCs in different experiments are related to depth range and strength of the jets. In the interior, stacked jets are characterized by eastward wave propagation suggesting that high baroclinic mode Kelvin waves radiate energy generated in the WBC into the interior and form the stacked jets.

   abstract = {The most common methodology used to detect and characterize mesoscale eddies in the global ocean is to analyze altimetry-based sea-level gridded products with an automatic eddy detection and tracking algorithm. However, a careful look at the location of altimetry tracks shows that their separation is often larger than the Rossby radius of deformation. This implies that gridded products based on the information obtained along track would potentially be unable to characterize the mesoscale variability and, in particular, the eddy field. In this study, we analyze up to what extent sea-level gridded products are able to characterize mesoscale eddies with a special focus on the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. In order to perform this task, we have generated synthetic sea level anomaly maps using along-track data extracted from realistic high-resolution ocean model simulations and applying an optimal interpolation procedure. Then, we have used an eddy detection and tracking algorithm to the gridded synthetic product and to the original model outputs and compared the characteristics of the resulting eddy fields. Our results suggest that gridded products largely underestimate the density of eddies, capturing only between 6% and 16% of the total number of eddies. The main reason is that the spatial resolution of the gridded products is not enough to capture the small-scale eddies that are the most abundant. Also, the unresolved structures are aliased into larger structures in the gridded products, so those products show an unrealistic number of large eddies with overestimated amplitudes.},

Exact dynamical and kinematic consistency is a key advantage of ASTE_R1, distinguishing the state estimate from existing ocean reanalyses. Through strict adherence to conservation laws, all sources and sinks within ASTE_R1 can be accounted for, permitting meaningful analysis of closed budgets at the grid-scale, such as contributions of horizontal and vertical convergence to the tendencies of heat and salt. ASTE_R1 thus serves as the biggest effort undertaken to date of producing a specialized Arctic ocean-ice estimate over the 21st century. Transports of volume, heat, and freshwater are consistent with published observation-based estimates across important Arctic Mediterranean gateways. Interannual variability and low frequency trends of freshwater and heat content are well represented in the Barents Sea, western Arctic halocline, and east subpolar North Atlantic. Systematic biases remain in ASTE_R1, including a warm bias in the Atlantic Water layer in the Arctic and deficient freshwater inputs from rivers and Greenland discharge.},

   abstract = {Mesoscale dynamics of the Agulhas Current system determine the exchange between the Indian and Atlantic oceans, thereby influencing the global overturning circulation. Using a series of ocean model experiments compared to observations, we show that the representation of mesoscale eddies in the Agulhas ring path improves with increasing resolution of submesoscale flows. Simulated submesoscale dynamics are validated with time-mean horizontal-wavenumber spectra from satellite sea surface temperature measurements and mesoscale dynamics with spectra from sea surface height. While the Agulhas ring path in a nonsubmesoscale-resolving (1/20)° configuration is associated with too less power spectral densities on all scales and too steep spectral slopes, the representation of the mesoscale dynamics improves when the diffusion and the dissipation of the model are reduced and some small-scale features are resolved. Realistic power spectral densities over all scales are achieved when additionally the horizontal resolution is increased to (1/60)° and a larger portion of the submesoscale spectrum is resolved. Results of an eddy detection algorithm applied to the model outputs as well as to a gridded sea surface height satellite product show that in particular strong cyclones are much better represented when submesoscale flows are resolved by the model. The validation of the submesoscale dynamics with sea surface temperature spectra provides guidance for the choice of advection schemes and explicit diffusion and dissipation as well as for further subgrid-scale parameterizations. For the Agulhas ring path, the use of upstream biased advection schemes without explicit diffusion and dissipation is found to be associated with realistically simulated submesoscales.},

Periods of northward flow are characterized by a meridional velocity maximum close to the surface, while southward phases show a subsurface velocity maximum at about 40 m. We show that the observed asymmetry is caused by the local winds. Southerly wind stress at the equator drives northward flow near the surface and southward flow below that is superimposed on the Tropical Instability Wave (TIW) velocity field. This wind-driven overturning cell, known as the Equatorial Roll, shows a distinct seasonal cycle linked to the seasonality of the meridional component of the south-easterly trade winds. The superposition of vertical shear of the Equatorial Roll and TIWs causes asymmetric mixing during northward and southward TIW phases.},

Numerical experiments with and without applied wind stress and an imposed MOC exhibit significant differences in intergyre transport, western boundary current intensity, and mesoscale ring production. The character of interaction between low-latitude wind-and overturning-driven circulation systems is found to be predominantly a linear superposition in the annual mean, even though nonlinearity in the form of diapycnal transport is essential to some segments of the mean pathway. Within a mesoscale band of 10-100 day period, significant nonlinear enhancement of near-surface variability is observed. In a realistically forced model experiment, a 14 Sv upper-ocean MOC return flow is partitioned among three pathways connecting the equatorial and tropical wind-driven gyres. A frictional western boundary current with both surface and intermediate depth components is the dominant pathway and accounts for 6.8 Sv of intergyre transport. A diapycnal pathway involving wind-forced equatorial upwelling and interior Ekman transport is responsible for 4.2 Sv. Translating North Brazil Current rings contribute approximately 3.0 Sv of intergyre transport.},

These cycles have been profoundly altered due to the emission of greenhouse gasses and other anthropogenic substances by human activities, driving pervasive changes in Earth’s climate system. In 2022, the world’s oceans, as given by OHC, were again the hottest in the historical record and exceeded the previous 2021 record maximum. According to IAP/CAS data, the 0–2000 m OHC in 2022 exceeded that of 2021 by 10.9 ± 8.3 ZJ (1 Zetta Joules = 10 <sup>21</sup> Joules); and according to NCEI/NOAA data, by 9.1 ± 8.7 ZJ. Among seven regions, four basins (the North Pacific, North Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, and southern oceans) recorded their highest OHC since the 1950s. The salinity-contrast index, a quantification of the “salty gets saltier—fresh gets fresher” pattern, also reached its highest level on record in 2022, implying continued amplification of the global hydrological cycle. Regional OHC and salinity changes in 2022 were dominated by a strong La Niña event. Global upper-ocean stratification continued its increasing trend and was among the top seven in 2022. </p>},

The AMOC is maintained by cold, salty water sinking in the North Atlantic, so as the ocean warms from increasing greenhouse gases, and freshwater from melting glaciers enters the ocean, the AMOC may be weakened due to the change in temperature and salinity. (3) (4) (5) Weakening of the AMOC reduces the northward supply of salty water, which may weaken the AMOC further in a positive feedback loop. There is evidence from theory, (6) simplified models, (7) and paleo observations (8) of abrupt changes in the AMOC, indicating the presence of an AMOC threshold. This threshold suggests that if freshwater input exceeds a certain volume, the AMOC could weaken and collapse into a state of reduced flow. (9) What impacts might be expected if the threshold were crossed? An AMOC shutdown would cause cooling of the northern hemisphere (Fig 2), sea level rise in the Atlantic, an overall decrease in precipitation over Europe and North America, and a southwards shift in monsoons in South America and Africa. (10) (11) These impacts are robust and seen in many models, but their magnitude remains uncertain. Atmospheric circulation over Europe may also change, possibly causing more winter storms in Northern Europe and increasing summer rain around the Mediterranean.

Such shifts can drive international conflicts and are highly problematic for the communities and businesses that depend on these living marine resources. Advances in climate prediction mean that in some regions the drivers of these shifts can be forecast up to a decade ahead, although forecasts of distribution shifts on this critical time-scale, while highly sought after by stakeholders, have yet to materialise. Here, we demonstrate the application of decadal-scale climate predictions to the habitat and distribution of marine fish species. We show statistically significant forecast skill of individual years that outperform baseline forecasts 3–10 years ahead; forecasts of multi-year averages perform even better, yielding correlation coefficients in excess of 0.90 in some cases. We also demonstrate that the habitat shifts underlying conflicts over Atlantic mackerel fishing rights could have been foreseen. Our results show that climate predictions can provide information of direct relevance to stakeholders on the decadal-scale. This tool will be critical in foreseeing, adapting to and coping with the challenges of a changing future climate, particularly in the most ocean-dependent nations and communities.},

   abstract = {The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key component of the climate through its transport of heat in the North Atlantic Ocean. Decadal changes in the AMOC, whether through internal variability or anthropogenically forced weakening, therefore have wide-ranging impacts. In this Review, we synthesize the understanding of contemporary decadal variability in the AMOC, bringing together evidence from observations, ocean reanalyses, forced models and AMOC proxies. Since 1980, there is evidence for periods of strengthening and weakening, although the magnitudes of change (5–25%) are uncertain. In the subpolar North Atlantic, the AMOC strengthened until the mid-1990s and then weakened until the early 2010s, with some evidence of a strengthening thereafter; these changes are probably linked to buoyancy forcing related to the North Atlantic Oscillation. In the subtropics, there is some evidence of the AMOC strengthening from 2001 to 2005 and strong evidence of a weakening from 2005 to 2014. Such large interannual and decadal variability complicates the detection of ongoing long-term trends, but does not preclude a weakening associated with anthropogenic warming. Research priorities include developing robust and sustainable solutions for the long-term monitoring of the AMOC, observation–modelling collaborations to improve the representation of processes in the North Atlantic and better ways to distinguish anthropogenic weakening from internal variability.},

Aquarius data show that the magnitude of SSS anomalies associated with the Atlantic TIWs is ±0.25 practical salinity unit, which is weaker than those in the Pacific by 50%. In the central equatorial Atlantic, SSS contribution to the mean meridional density gradient is similar to sea surface temperature (SST) contribution. Consequently, SSS is important to TIW-related surface density anomalies and perturbation potential energy (PPE). In this region, SSS influences surface PPE significantly through the direct effect and the indirect effect associated with SSS-SST covariability. Ignoring SSS effects would underestimate TIW-related PPE by approximately three times in the surface layer. SSS also regulates the seasonality of the TIWs. The boreal-spring peak of the PPE due to SSS leads that due to SST by about one month. Therefore, SSS not only affects the spatial structure, but the seasonal variability of the TIWs in the equatorial Atlantic. In the northeast Atlantic near the Amazon outflow and the North Brazil Current retroflection region and in the southeast Atlantic near the Congo River outflow, SSS accounts for 80-90% of the contribution to mean meridional density gradient. Not accounting for SSS effect would underestimate surface PPE in these regions by a factor of 10 and 4, respectively.},

We examine the relative contributions of SSS and SST to the horizontal surface density gradient on seasonal and interannual time scales and how they contribute to the TIW properties and energetics. For the central Atlantic TIWs, the maximum of the SST contribution to the density anomaly lags the SSS one by approximately one month. Argo vertical profiles indicate that temperature and salinity both significantly contribute to TIW-related density anomalies. In May–June, salinity contributes to 50% of the perturbation potential energy in the top 60 m, and between 30% and 45% from July to September. While variations in SST appear to be related to dynamic processes, the interannual variability of SSS is also influenced by precipitations.

Intensive trans-basin AMOC observational systems have been put in place to continuously monitor meridional volume transport variability, and in some cases, heat, freshwater and carbon transport. These observational programs have been used to diagnose the magnitude and origins of transport variability, and to investigate impacts of variability on essential climate variables such as sea surface temperature, ocean heat content and coastal sea level. AMOC observing approaches vary between the different systems, ranging from trans-basin arrays (OSNAP, RAPID 26°N, 11°S, SAMBA 34.5°S) to arrays concentrating on western boundaries (e.g., RAPID WAVE, MOVE 16°N). In this paper, we outline the different approaches (aims, strengths and limitations) and summarize the key results to date. We also discuss alternate approaches for capturing AMOC variability including direct estimates (e.g., using sea level, bottom pressure, and hydrography from autonomous profiling floats), indirect estimates applying budgetary approaches, state estimates or ocean reanalyses, and proxies. Based on the existing observations and their results, and the potential of new observational and formal synthesis approaches, we make suggestions as to how to evaluate a comprehensive, future-proof observational network of the AMOC to deepen our understanding of the AMOC and its role in global climate.},

The sea surface in the subpolar gyre is now as cold as it was during the last cold phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index in the 1990s. This climate index is associated with shifts in hurricane activity, rainfall patterns and intensity, and changes in fish populations. However, unlike the last cold period in the Atlantic, the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic is not uniformly cool, but instead has anomalously cold temperatures in the subpolar gyre, warm temperatures in the subtropics and cool anomalies over the tropics. The tripole pattern of anomalies has increased the subpolar to subtropical meridional gradient in SSTs, which are not represented by the AMO index value, but which may lead to increased atmospheric baroclinicity and storminess. Here we show that the recent Atlantic cooling is likely to persist, as predicted by a statistical forecast of subsurface ocean temperatures and consistent with the irreversible nature of watermass changes involved in the recent cooling of the subpolar gyre.</p>},

It is found that on decadal timescales, flux anomalies over the subpolar North Atlantic have the largest impact on the AMOC, while on multidecadal timescales (longer than 20 years), flux anomalies in the Arctic become more important. These positive buoyancy anomalies spread to the North Atlantic, weakening the AMOC and its poleward heat transport. Therefore, the Arctic sea-ice decline may explain the suggested slow-down of the AMOC and the 'Warming Hole' persisting in the subpolar North Atlantic.},

   abstract = {The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) can be considered to consist of a downwelling limb in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and an upwelling limb in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) that are connected via western boundary currents. Steady-state analytical gyre-scale solutions of the planetary geostrophic equations are derived for a downwelling limb driven in the NH solely by surface heat loss. In these solutions the rates of the water mass transformations between layers driven by the surface heat loss determine the strength of the downwelling limb. Simple expressions are obtained for these transformation rates that depend on the most southerly latitudes where heat loss occurs and the depths of the isopycnals on the eastern boundary. Previously derived expressions for the water mass transformation rates in subpolar gyres driven by the Ekman upwelling characteristic of the SH are also summarized. Explicit expressions for the MOC transport and the depths of isopycnals on the eastern boundary are then derived by equating the water mass transformations in the upwelling and downwelling limbs. The MOC obtained for a "single-basin" two-layer model is shown to be generally consistent with that obtained by Gnanadesikan. The model's energetics are derived and discussed. In a world without a circumpolar channel in the SH, it is suggested that the upwelling limb would feed downwelling limbs in both hemispheres. In a world with two basins in the NH, if one of them has a strong halocline the model suggests that the MOC would be very weak in that basin.},

   abstract = {The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) conducted the second Japanese global atmospheric reanalysis, called the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis or JRA-55. It covers the period from 1958, when regular radiosonde observations began on a global basis. JRA-55 is the first comprehensive reanalysis that has covered the last half-century since the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 45-year Reanalysis (ERA-40), and is the first one to apply four-dimensional variational analysis to this period. The main objectives of JRA-55 were to address issues found in previous reanalyses and to produce a comprehensive atmospheric dataset suitable for studying multidecadal variability and climate change. This paper describes the observations, data assimilation system, and forecast model used to produce JRA-55 as well as the basic characteristics of the JRA-55 product. JRA-55 has been produced with the TL319 version of JMA’s operational data assimilation system as of December 2009, which was extensively improved since the Japanese 25-year Reanalysis (JRA-25). It also uses several newly available and improved past observations. The resulting reanalysis products are considerably better than the JRA-25 product. Two major problems of JRA-25 were a cold bias in the lower stratosphere, which has been diminished, and a dry bias in the Amazon basin, which has been mitigated. The temporal consistency of temperature analysis has also been considerably improved compared to previous reanalysis products. Our initial quality evaluation revealed problems such as a warm bias in the upper troposphere, large upward imbalance in the global mean net energy fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface, excessive precipitation over the tropics, and unrealistic trends in analyzed tropical cyclone strength. This paper also assesses the impacts of model biases and changes in the observing system, and mentions efforts to further investigate the representation of low-frequency variability and trends in JRA-55.},

   abstract = {Using outputs from a high-resolution OGCM, seasonal and interannual variations of the Angola Dome (AD) are revisited. Although the AD was previously considered to be one large cold tongue extending from the West African coast, it is shown that two cold domes exist. These two domes have remarkably different mechanisms for their seasonal variation. The weak dome, whose center is located at 6°S, 1°E, develops from May to September owing to the divergence of heat transport associated with upwelling. The strong dome, on the other hand, extends from the west coast of Africa between 20° and 15°S, and develops from April to August by the surface heat flux. The interannual variation of the weak dome is strongly influenced by the Atlantic Niño. An unusual relaxation of easterly wind stress in the central equatorial Atlantic Ocean associated with the Atlantic Niño triggers second baroclinic downwelling equatorial Kelvin waves, which propagate eastward along the equator and poleward along the coast after reaching the African coast as coastal Kelvin waves. Then, downwelling Rossby waves radiate away from the coast and cause significant warming in the weak dome region. The interannual variation of the South Equatorial Undercurrent may be associated with that of the AD; its transport decreases by 0.6 Sv, and its core shifts equatorward by 0.2° when the AD is anomalously weak. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {<p>Of all the major coastal upwelling systems in the world’s oceans, the Benguela, located off southwest Africa, is the one that climate models find hardest to simulate well. This paper investigates the sensitivity of upwelling processes, and of sea surface temperature (SST), in this region to resolution of the climate model and to the offshore wind structure. The Community Climate System Model (version 4) is used here, together with the Regional Ocean Modeling System. The main result is that a realistic wind stress curl at the eastern boundary, and a high-resolution ocean model, are required to well simulate the Benguela upwelling system. When the wind stress curl is too broad (as with a 1° atmosphere model or coarser), a Sverdrup balance prevails at the eastern boundary, implying southward ocean transport extending as far as 30°S and warm advection. Higher atmosphere resolution, up to 0.5°, does bring the atmospheric jet closer to the coast, but there can be too strong a wind stress curl. The most realistic representation of the upwelling system is found by adjusting the 0.5° atmosphere model wind structure near the coast toward observations, while using an eddy-resolving ocean model. A similar adjustment applied to a 1° ocean model did not show such improvement. Finally, the remote equatorial Atlantic response to restoring SST in a broad region offshore of Benguela is substantial; however, there is not a large response to correcting SST in the narrow coastal upwelling zone alone.</p>},
