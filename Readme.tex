\section{Wind-forcing comparison in
INALT20}\label{wind-forcing-comparison-in-inalt20}

Authors: Kristin Burmeister, Franziska Schwarzkopf, Arne Biastoch, Peter
Brandt, Joke Luebbecke, Mark Inall

\section{Aim:}\label{aim}

In this study the difference between the COREv2 (Griffies et al. (2009))
and JRA55-do (Tsujino et al. (2018)) forcing in INALT20 (Schwarzkopf et
al. (2019)) is investigated with respect to the upper wind-driven ocean
circulation in the tropical Atlantic. Where possible, the model outputs
are validated and the analysis is extended by observational data.

\section{Motivation:}\label{motivation}

The COREv2 wind forcing is known to exhibit spurious multidecadal wind
variability (Hurrell and Trenberth, 1998; Fiorino, 2000;, He et al.,
2016). This presumable impacts the multidecadal variability of the
wind-driven circulation in the tropical Atlantic in model simulation
forced by COREv2. The upper wind-driven circulation in the tropical
Atlantic plays a key role in the basin wide distribution of water mass
properties and affects the transport of heat, salt and biogeochemical
components like oxygen (Fig. \ref{fig_schema} and e.g. Schott, McCreary
Jr., and Johnson (2004), Hazeleger and Drijfhout (2006), Oschlies et al.
(2018)). It is an important feature of the Atlantic climate system and
the marine ecology in a warming world. Hence, it is crucial to improve
the understanding of its long-term variability which is largly depending
on model simulation due to sparse observational data coverage in earlier
periods.

With INALT20 we have the opportunity to compare COREv2 with the new
JRA55-do forcing, identify differences in both forcings and learn more
about the multidecadal variability of the tropical Atlantic.

\subsection{Comparison between JRA55-do and COREv2 in
INALT20}\label{comparison-between-jra55-do-and-corev2-in-inalt20}

As first step I calculated relative wind stress anomalies with respect
to the 1958-2009 seasonal cycle based on monthly mean data of the host
model (1/4°). Then I calculate the annual mean of the anomalies and
spatially average them between 3°S and 3°N for 10°-wide zonal boxes
along the equatorial Atlantic (Fig. \ref{fig_JRA_CORE_10deg} and
\ref{fig_JRA_CORE_diff}). Please note, similar results are optained
using the nested model (1/20°) (see
\href{./figures/1_INALT_JRA_CORE_taux_anomaly_3s3n_40w10e.png}{1\_INALT\_JRA\_CORE\_taux\_anomaly\_3s3n\_40w10e.png}
and
\href{./figures/INALT20_wind_forcing_comparison/1_INALT_JRA_minus_CORE_taux_anomaly_3s3n_40w10e.png}{1\_INALT\_JRA\_minus\_CORE\_taux\_anomaly\_3s3n\_40w10e.png}
in the \href{https://github.com/Kristin-2002/Wind_forcing.git}{GitHub
repository}).

\caption{Annual mean wind stress anomalies with respect to the 1958-2009

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{./figures/INALT20_wind_forcing_comparison/INALT_JRA_minus_CORE_taux_anomaly_3s3n_40w10e.png}
\caption{Difference of annual mean wind stress anomalies between JRA and
CORE forcing (see Fig.
\ref{fig_JRA_CORE_10deg}).\label{fig_JRA_CORE_diff}}
\end{figure}

The difference in zonal wind stress anomalies increase to the east of
the basin (Fig. \ref{fig_JRA_CORE_10deg} and \ref{fig_JRA_CORE_diff}).

But only for the period before 1990 - afterwards they agree quite well
in the easter basin, whereas, at approxiately the same time (late
1990s), they begin to deviate from each other in the western boxes.

For a better presentation of the difference of the forcings depending on
the longitude I created hovmoeller diagrams of zonal wind stress
anomlies latidunal averaged for diffrent longitudinal bands (Fig.
\ref{fig_JRA_CORE_4N6N} to \ref{fig_JRA_CORE_6S4S}).

CORE. \label{fig_JRA_CORE_6S4S}}
\end{figure}

In general, the CORE zonal wind stress anomalies in the CORE forcing are
stronger and zonally coherent (Fig. \ref{fig_JRA_CORE_4N6N} to
\ref{fig_JRA_CORE_6S4S} centre). In JRA, north of the equator, zonal
wind anomalies are not zonally coherent and reverse sign at about 20°W
(Fig. \ref{fig_JRA_CORE_4N6N} to \ref{fig_JRA_CORE_6S4S} left).
Differences between JRA and CORE increases from south to north (Fig.
\ref{fig_JRA_CORE_4N6N} to \ref{fig_JRA_CORE_6S4S} right). This is also
clearly visible in the meridional section of zonal wind stress anomalies
along 23°W (Fig. \ref{fig_JRA_CORE_taux_23w}).

The largest differences (up to \(\pm\) 0.03 N\(\,\)m\(^{-2}\)) between
both forcings occur east of 30°W before 1990 (Fig.
\ref{fig_JRA_CORE_1deg}). With CORE showing stronger eastward wind
stress anomalies compared to JRA between 1958 and 1970 and stronger
westward wind stress anomalies between 1970 and 1990.

\subsection{Zonal velocity along 23°W: INATL20 and
observation}\label{zonal-velocity-along-23w-inatl20-and-observation}

To validate INALT20 we compare it to longterm observations along 23°W.
Currently an updated version of a mean section along 23°W is work in
progress. For now I compare the model to published mean section along
23°W (Brandt et al. (2015),Kristin Burmeister et al. (2020)). Lets start
with the comparison of the simulated zonal velocities along 23°W of the
JRA and CORE forcings (Fig. \ref{fig_JRA_CORE_ucur_23w}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.50000\textwidth]{./figures/INALT20_obs_23w_comparison/1_INALT20_CORE_JRA_obs_23w_1999_2009.png}
\caption{Zonal velocities along 23°W from INALT20 forced by a) JRA and
b) CORE averaged for the period 1999-2009 (shading). Black contours mark
observed zonal velocities averaged for the 1999-2012 period (Brandt et
al., 2015). \label{fig_JRA_CORE_ucur_23w}}
\end{figure}

The westward flowing nSEC (centered at about 2.5°N) and the eastward
flowing NEUC (centered at about 5°N) are stronger and extend further
down (\(\sim\) 200m for JRA, 400m for CORE) in the simlation forced by
CORE (Fig. \ref{fig_JRA_CORE_ucur_23w}). Overall, JRA forced zonal
velocities seems to be closer to observation (Fig.
\ref{fig_JRA_CORE_ucur_23w}, \ref{fig_JRA_obs_brandt_23w} and
\ref{fig_JRA_obs_burmeister_23w}) as the CORE forced ones. However, the
nNECC (centered about 8.5°N) seemed to be better simulated by the CORE
forcing (Fig. \ref{fig_JRA_CORE_23w}). Please note that the northern
boundary of the nest is 10°N and the nNECC is located close to it.

\begin{figure}

\label{fig_JRA_obs_burmeister_23w}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{EUC transport at 23°W}\label{euc-transport-at-23w}

To get a first impression, I calculated the EUC transport along 23°W
after Brandt et al. (2014), i.e.~only positive (eastward) velocities are
integrated between 1.2°S and 1.2°N, 30m and 300m. I did that as a first
step to compare the results to Brandt et al. (2014) (Fig.
\ref{fig_brandt_et_al_2014_fig5}). The used observational dataset is
from Kristin Burmeister et al. (2020) (7 cruises during 2006-2012) and
apparently not all cruises from Brandt et al. (2014) (12 cruises during
2006-2012) are included. Unfortunately until now I could not find a list
of the cruises used in Brandt et al. (2014) but all cruises should be
included in the updated 23°W which is currently work in progress. Next,
I will use the algorithm of Hsin and Qiu (2012) to calculate current
transports, their central latitude and core depth.

\begin{figure}

\caption{EUC transports at 23°W calculated from INALT20 model output
(blue line for JRA, black line for CORE) and shipboard zonal velocities
(red circles). For the transport only positive (eastward) velocities are
integrated between 1.2°S and 1.2°N, 30m and 300m.}

\item

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Zonal current
characterization}\label{zonal-current-characterization}

For both, INALT20 and the observational data we calculate the central
position \$ Y\_\{CM\} \$ and along-pathway intensity \$ INT \$ of the
NEUC using the algorithm of Hsin and Qiu (2012).

\begin{equation}
Y_{CM}(x,t) = \frac{\int_{Z_l}^{Z_u} \int_{Y_{S}}^{Y_{N}} y\ u(x,y,z,t)\ dy\ dz}{\int_{Z_l}^{Z_u} \int_{Y_{S}}^{Y_{N}} u(x,y,z,t)\ dy\ dz}
\label{equ_Y_CM}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
INT(x,t) = \int_{Z_l}^{Z_u} \int_{Y_{CM}-W}^{Y_{CM}+W} u(x,y,z,t)\ dy\ dz 
\label{equ_INT}
\end{equation}

where \(y\) is latitude, \(x\) is longitude, \(u\) is zonal velocity,
\(z\) is depth, \(t\) is time, \(Z_u\) (\(Z_l\)) is upper (lower)
boundary of the flow, \(Y_N\) (\(Y_S\)) is northern (southern) limit of
the flow, and \(W\) is the half mean width of the flow.

The advantage of this method is that the transport calculation follows
the current core avoiding artifacts if the current is meridionally
migrating.
